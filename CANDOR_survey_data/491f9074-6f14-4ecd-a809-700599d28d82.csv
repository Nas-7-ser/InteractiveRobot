I have an essay to work on and a group meeting for a presentation later in the week and it will feel a little overwhelming but I know that once I start work on those assignments and the other ones that are due this week I'll feel a lot better. ,I thought that we had a few things in common that we talked in length about. We were both staying at home and the main finance manager in our households and we discussed the problems we had with budgeting. I thought that we had a good discussion about the study as well seeing as we had both done the study twice before.  ,I thought that my partner talked a lot more at length about certain subjects that I wasn't as interested in talking about. I went with the conversation and once we started talking about the study and Prolific I was a little more interested in the conversation. The main problem I had with the conversation was that I wanted to know more about himself but the conversation wasn't steering toward that direction.,2.0,5.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,7.0,3.0,6.0,3.0,3.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,38.0,62.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,4.0,23.0,,,4.0,23.0,,,3.0,3.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,female,4.0,asian,some_college,7.0,Student,5.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,22.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.375,5.666666666666667,,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.6666666666666667,4.666666666666667,2.3333333333333335,5.0,3.6666666666666665,1.6666666666666667,3.6666666666666665,4.333333333333333,2.3333333333333335,2.3333333333333335,,
