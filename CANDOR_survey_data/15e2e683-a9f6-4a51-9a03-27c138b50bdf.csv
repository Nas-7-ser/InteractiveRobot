My husband is off tomorrow so we will go on a breakfast date while my son is in school. We will have a quick workout session and sweat. His family is coming into town this weekend so it will be interesting to see the dynamic. I have one more work day. ,"We both were excited to keep it going. We brought up different subjects and kept relating to one another. I did feel I spoke more than her, but she was happily listening. Her camera did go out so it was a bit weird towards the end because it felt as if though I was talking to myself. ",I was doing the majority of the talking. I feel like I need to fill any silence. I speak really fast and felt bad because I kept taking over the conversation. She didn't seem to mind and loved asking questions about me and why I did things. She seemed to enjoy learning more about me. ,1.0,3.0,9.0,4.0,7.0,1.0,9.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,9.0,4.0,6.0,9.0,1.0,70.0,30.0,8.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,,2.0,,4.0,25.0,,,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,female,6.0,hispanic_or_latino,bachelors_degree,1.0,,8.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,37.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.625,5.333333333333333,,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.666666666666667,3.6666666666666665,5.0,3.6666666666666665,4.0,4.0,4.333333333333333,5.0,1.6666666666666667,3.3333333333333335,,

I see the rest of the week passing pretty slowly as I get my stuff done. Hopefully I can find something to look forward to. ","My partner was extremely enthusiastic, comfortable, and talked a lot. We didn't have many awkward pauses because she would transition from topic to topic on her own, and I only had to prompt or offer questions once in a while. She was also open about her issues and I felt like I knew her based on what she was saying. ","I was already feeling a little bit low energy going into the conversation, so I felt somewhat disconnected as she talked and I listened. When she talked for extended periods of time, I felt myself losing focus or attention and only being able to ask questions about specific phrases I heard and remembered.
