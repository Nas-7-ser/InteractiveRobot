I don't foresee any problems this week. I have several study sessions planned, as well as work (2 shifts) over the weekend. Additionally, I have household management tasks and time for relaxation built in. I also need to workout this week. That's usually fun. ","My conversation partner and I had a lot in common- we live in the same state, we are the same race, we have both attended Texas Tech University, and we enjoy some of the same past times. This gave us multiple talking points during the conversation. The amount of awkward silence was very low. We were able to keep a fun conversation going, with both of us laughing at points. ","I sometimes felt that partner was too quiet and did not know what to say. I felt I had to talk to make up for the awkward silence. I sometimes have a tendency to talk too much, however, so I asked him to tell me if I was talking too much. I did not want to dominate the conversation.
