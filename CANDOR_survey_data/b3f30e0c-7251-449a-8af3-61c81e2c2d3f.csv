I have to do a ton of things to prepare for school and get my life together. I also have work which is good since I will be making some money.,"We were in a similar age range which helped with bringing up topics to talk about. We were able to talk about school and our majors. Since we both take these surveys, we had similar experiences and were able to talk about them. Since we were similar in age, we could talk about a lot of issues with similar mindsets. ","Honestly, the conversation and video chat did not have any downfalls. The video quality was pretty good and our conversation was pretty steady. I was happily surprised at how well it went considering he was a random stranger. We were both confused at the beginning about what to talk about but we came up with a good amount of topics pretty quickly.

It might be a little stressful. I am applying to a few schools this week so that might be a little hectic. But I'm also taking a short trip to see a few old friends this weekend so I'm excited about that.,"We ended up talking about memes and current events which made the conversation fun. The beginning of the conversation was a little slow because it was a lot of small talk, but my parter brought up WWIII memes we ended up having a pretty solid conversation. Our humor ended up kind of matching too, so that helped.","It was kind of hard to find a topic to discuss at the beginning without knowing anything about each other. The initial simple small talk (where are you from, what do you do) ended with some dead ends in the conversation, though it was still enjoyable. My energy level was pretty low at the beginning so that didn't help.",5.0,5.0,7.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,8.0,7.0,55.0,45.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,12.0,,,4.0,12.0,,,5.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,,male,4.0,white,bachelors_degree,3.0,,,,2.0,,False,,,26.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6.125,6.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.6666666666666665,2.6666666666666665,1.3333333333333333,3.3333333333333335,5.0,4.0,4.666666666666667,3.0,3.0,4.0,,
