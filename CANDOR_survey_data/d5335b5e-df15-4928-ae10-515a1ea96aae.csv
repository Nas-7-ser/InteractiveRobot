Maddie then mentioned that all the other people she had spoken with where around 40, and I said that I talked with a woman yesterday that was 18. We then talked about our experience doing this study. She mentioned she had done this process about 4 times, and I mentioned that this conversation was my second time. I mentioned that I have conversations all day for my job as a crisis line operator. She said that she is in medical school, but studied Neuroscience in college. I also studied Neuroscience in college, so we talked about that for a short while. She talked about what she wanted to do with her neuroscience degree. She mentioned she had gone out of the U.S.A. to practice medicine in Honduras. At this point, she mentioned that she felt like she had done most of the talking.",7.0,7.0,8.0,"I started talking about my experience abroad in Europe, and how I also had a great experience living life like locals. I talked more about my experience in France, and how I traveled a lot while I was there. I mentioned that it had nothing to do with my degree, but that I enjoyed it, and it was something I wanted to do. We talked about living in big cities, and how it wasn't something we'd want to do.",8.0,8.0,8.0,"I mentioned how I was happy with my life right now, as I changed my plans for graduate school last minute and ended up not moving to Tennessee. She said that it was probably best to stay near home with everything going on. We talked more about our experience abroad, and she said she visited Colmar as a child; I mentioned I also visited Colmar. I mentioned that I loved France, but didn't want to live there due to cultural differences, and the lack of air conditioning. She talked about her summer job as a nanny, and how her apartment didn't have AC but she would stay at her nanny-job late after the kids were gone to get their AC, and go home after the sun went down. I mentioned how I also babysat over the summer, but for my aunt and uncle, and that my cousins were not well-behaved, and that I somehow always got myself into childcare jobs despite having little patience. She mentioned that the family she nannied for was going through a divorce, so the kids would act out physically. At this point, it was near the end of the call, so we wished each other well with life and our studies and ended the call.",5.0,6.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,7.0,6.0,9.0,100.0,11.0,85.0,93.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,1.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,8.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,7.0,8.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,9.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,"I have a positive feeling about the rest of the week. Although I have to work about 30 hours at my stressful job, I know that positive things are going to happen to me. This week is my birthday week, and I get to see my best friend and her new boyfriend tomorrow, so I am happy.","We both listened and took turns speaking. At one point, she mentioned she felt like she had done most of the talking and invited me to change the subject. I really appreciated that she thought about what I had to say, thought that conversation time wasn't fairly allotted, and wanted me to speak more","There were a few times where the conversation topic lagged in between thoughts, or we spoke over each other. Because of the video medium, it was sometimes hard to tell when the other person was finished with their thought.

I liked speaking to someone that was a similar age to me and how we were able to talk about being at the same stage in our lives. That made it a lot easier to have a back and forth conversation. ,"Part of the reason the conversation didn't go as well as it could have was because of our hesitation to share too much about ourselves to a random person on the internet.
