Staying in my apartment. Tomorrow I will order groceries online, other than that I will be looking for ways to earn money online as I do with prolific. Saturday morning I will attend a virtual service with my synagogue, other than that, each day will be the same.","We were both very much in agreement with how we felt about the things that are going on in our world today and about politics and other such issues. It would have been much harder if the other person and I have very different views on those things. Also, my conversation partner has spent some years in Africa, a place I've always wanted to visit. ","It took a couple of minutes to really get going in the conversation, as one would expect if they are talking to someone they don't know. There was also the age difference when I mentioned the movie ""Born Free"" it occurred to me that someone under 30 wouldn't know what I was talking about.

My work gets much easier and less busy as I get closer to Friday and each day becomes less stressful. I think the rest of my week will see a lessening of work to be done, more focus on my goals (hoping to get into the gym and keep my spending below a certain amount), and hopefully get to go on a date with this cute new girl I've been talking to. 
Pretty chill, positive week","We were both very nice and open people, willing to do whatever it took to complete our assignment. I think we were pleasantly surprised that we were both pleasant people and shared the same political beliefs. We were both ok with using some light humor and looked for our commonalities right away, which helped anchor the conversation.","There was some sadness and weirdness when our conversation touched on some of the unfair differences in our lives, namely the economic pressures my partner faces. Its not so much that it didn't work, but that it interjected a not great vibe and we both felt instinctually to skirt those topics and not press.
