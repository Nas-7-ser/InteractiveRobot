If the weather is good and the people I enjoy are willing to hang out with me, I could see things being very good. If I feel isolated, and it's cold and rainy outside, it's likely I will feel quite badly.","We were both from the same general area of the United States, meaning we had some sort of basic connection right off the get go. We also had a connection based on a local university. She seemed genuinely interested in my answers and asked some follow-up questions which made for a pretty good conversation.","Between us, I felt there was something of a lack of connection based on our personalities and ourselves in general. She was 14 years older than me, making it more difficult to relate, and her being a woman versus me a man, we lacked some common ground there.

I will do some household chores such as laundry and dishes. I will also homeschool my son every day except for the weekend and Friday. I will also do some gardening outside this weekend and plant more of my vegetables and flowers. Overall I think the rest of the week will be great.,I think what worked well is we were both college students so we could relate on that commonality. We also are both experiencing quarantine in the same state so we were able to relate quite well on that topic. We are both very friendly people that are introverts but I think we made it work well.,"We are both introverts so there were a few seconds when we didn't have much to talk about. I feel like we jumped from subject to subject because we were both a bit nervous about talking with a complete stranger online.
