I have multiple essay due and Im starting my second job. I havent seen my girlfriend in a week and I dont anticipate seeing her soon. Im just holding out at this point for the fall semester to start at school and i move back to the city,I think things worked well when I allowed her to talk about thing more than I did. I felt the things I was talking about werenâ€™t relatable to her and wouldnt be that different from things shes already lived through. But being older she was able to talk about plenty of things I didnt already know,"I think trying to talk like a blind date worked very poorly. Whats your name, hobbys, etc dont matter because I wont be talking with you again. focusing more on tell me something i dont know helped. I also tend to talk about very boyish and simplistic things when i first meet someone and it seemed she wasnt interested in that",5.0,4.0,2.0,7.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,8.0,9.0,9.0,4.0,30.0,70.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,9.0,9.0,6.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,25.0,,,4.0,25.0,,,5.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,7.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,male,4.0,mixed,some_college,1.0,,8.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,20.0,4.0,,50.0,0.0,50.0,0.0,0.0,70.0,0.0,0.0,30.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,6.0,7.0,1.0,3.0,,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,5.75,6.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,4.666666666666667,3.6666666666666665,1.3333333333333333,5.0,4.333333333333333,5.0,3.6666666666666665,4.333333333333333,4.666666666666667,family,in_person

I will also be avoiding my mother as she is childish and refusing to talk to me. I see it being a fairly uneventful week and its tone will be dependent on how well my father and I get along and how much I am forced to be exposed to my mother.",We were both open minded and listened to the other talk without interrupting. We let the conversation flow naturally from topic to topic. We asked each other follow-up questions and shared personal experiences that related to what the other person was saying. We treated each other with kindness and respect and valued the perspective of the other person and their experience.,"It was a bit awkward in the beginning because we didn't really know what to talk about. We didn't know anything about the other person so we didn't know what to say. I didn't want to sit there for half an hour being bored so I asked ""So how was your day today?"" and after that the conversation just flowed naturally and we had no problems.",3.0,5.0,7.0,5.0,9.0,5.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,9.0,9.0,4.0,60.0,40.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,7.0,2.0,2.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,,1.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,7.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,female,6.0,white,bachelors_degree,4.0,,10.0,6.5,2.0,,False,,,38.0,3.0,,67.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,33.0,67.0,0.0,33.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,2.0,2.0,,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.125,7.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.666666666666667,2.3333333333333335,2.0,3.3333333333333335,4.333333333333333,4.0,5.0,4.666666666666667,1.0,3.6666666666666665,family,in_person
