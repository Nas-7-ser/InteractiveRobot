They work at a flower shop and have been out of work for the entire quarantine. Their child is also out of school and has been loving the time at home and online distance learning. They live in Portland, so they haven't been out of lockdown at all. ",6.0,6.0,7.0,We discussed video games for quite a while! They are a PS4 fan like I am and they like very similar games as I do. They too are not big into competitive gaming and prefer single-player games where they can relax and enjoy a good storyline. They are currently saving up for a PS5 which is why they are doing these surveys!,7.0,6.0,8.0,"We talked a lot about animals toward the end of the conversation. Their cat is getting old and so they are spoiling him! They currently only have two cats, but were thinking of getting a kitten until their older cat started to slow down. We also discussed the type of dog I'm planning to get in the future, as well as how much we enjoyed talking to each other.

I am also hoping to have some photoshoots and to enjoy my time off for a little while! I also hope to do some job searching and try to find another part-time job, but we'll see how that goes! Aside from that, just trying to de-stress. ","We had a lot in common! More than my previous two conversations on this platform. We both love animals, both love the same kind of video games, and are both adjusting to life around COVID. I believe we took an equal time talking to each other and no one was drowning out the other. ","There is very little that didn't work well. I think the one thing we didn't have in common was having a kid, but I still found it interesting to talk about it with them. They don't have a dog, either, but still enjoyed listening to me talk about mine so I really can't find many flaws in this conversation.

We are both home from work. She is able to work from home some while I can not. We talked about the struggle of getting enough physical movement in for ourselves (and families).,7.0,7.0,8.0,In the middle of the conversation we talked about why we are doing suveys on Prolific. My conversation partner is saving for a new puppy and I am saving for a PS5. We talked about being ok with staying home and being shy people,7.0,7.0,8.0,Toward the end of the conversation we were still talking about video games. We compared favorite games and talked about being frustrated when controller mapping changes between games and having to relearn the controls. We also talked about our elderly animals.

I will be supervising school from home so we have to set up a work space and figure out easymeals and a routine so that I can get my work done and kiddo can be supported in their school day. But there will also be a lot of snuggling with my old man cat on the couch since the weather just turned colder,The thing that worked the best about the conversation I think was finding common interests. It seems like we are both pretty introverted and awkward people. There were some awkward pauses at the begining of the conversation that I was worried would continue through out the conversation but once we established that we both like video games and animals there was more to talk about,I think the biggest challenge to the conversation is that we both seem to be rather introverted. I usually struggle with small talk so there were awkward pauses in the beginning. I think it would have been a lot harder if there weren't a global issue that affects pretty much everyone like covid. If all else fails we can talk about how we are coping.,6.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,7.0,3.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,3.0,60.0,40.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,15.0,,,4.0,13.0,,,2.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,other_or_prefer_not_to_answer,6.0,white,bachelors_degree,3.0,,8.0,10.0,2.0,,False,,,35.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.25,5.0,,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.3333333333333335,4.333333333333333,2.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,2.6666666666666665,4.333333333333333,3.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,3.0,,
