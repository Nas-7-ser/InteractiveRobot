However, I will admit, that speaking with someone early this morning (before work) and having had a few laughs in may have made my day a little better. I think the week will kind of drag on and I know that I will be looking forward to the weekend (even though the week just began).","What worked well about the conversation is that I believe because of our similar cultural backgrounds (we were both Black),  that we had more to talk about and more that we can relate to. We spoke about Black colleges, Black movies and Black movements. I think what also worked well is that we had an age gap; I believe he was in his forties (I'm 24); so I think he looked at me like a daughter (he has one) and spoke to me like he would speak to his daughter.","The only thing that did not work well is that sometimes we didn't know what to talk about. The researchers did not give us a list of anything to discuss, so we just conversed about anything random. In a way that made us struggle to find things to talk about sometimes, but I think that probably was better...so that our conversation can be organic. Other than that, the conversation went well.
