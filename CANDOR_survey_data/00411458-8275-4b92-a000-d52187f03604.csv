I'll be somewhat busy but I think that overall I will have a good week. I'll mostly be doing some various errands and housework as well as preparing for the new semester of college that will start next week.,We seemed to have a good flow of conversation between the two of us. We had a few things in common that we could easily chat about. We both seemed to have a good sense of humor and that made our conversation go well. We both were friendly and eager to listen to each other.,There were a few moments where it felt somewhat awkward for me. This mainly happened when my conversation partner mentioned an ideology that I do not agree with. It also occurred with my conversation partner mentioned their feelings about race and inequality. I tend to be very vocal about my thoughts on issues like that so it was hard not to comment on that.,1.0,1.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,3.0,3.0,7.0,8.0,7.0,8.0,30.0,70.0,6.0,3.0,1.0,7.0,7.0,9.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,25.0,,,5.0,,1.0,2.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,,female,6.0,american_indian_or_alaska_native,some_college,7.0,Student,,,2.0,,False,,,22.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.875,5.333333333333333,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.6666666666666665,5.0,2.3333333333333335,4.333333333333333,2.0,5.0,4.333333333333333,3.6666666666666665,2.0,3.0,,

I have many things planned, and am not sick. The weather is looking good, and it is payday. I have some tasty foods to cook, and am happy. I saw all of my family recently, and have no bills to pay until next month. ","We both were from the same parts of the US. She was intelligent and friendly, and seemed kind. We both had cats and worked side hustles for extra cash. I liked talking to her because of the related interests, and she seemed to like the conversation as well. We were both comfortable. ","The video was a little bit choppy, and there was a delay between the voice which I think annoyed her. It would occasionally lead us to interrupt each other. I had fun, and there were not too many other things. Towards the end I think she was ready to do something else.
