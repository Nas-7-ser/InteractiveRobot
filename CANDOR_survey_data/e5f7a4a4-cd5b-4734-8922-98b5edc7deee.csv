Otherwise, I'll reach out to people on the phone and putter around the house as has become the new normal.","I think my conversation partner was very sweet and we are both leaning liberal.  I think we had a good sense of rapport despite being different ages.  There were no problematic moments or lack of understanding between us.  She was so polite, I felt, and politeness always makes for good social flow, even if we hadn't agreed on so many things.","Perhaps because I am older, I think I tend to dominate the conversation.  I don't mean to do this.  In part, counter-intuitively, it's because I do have some social anxiety and I overcompensate; but, also, I wonder if it is an unthinking, subconscious reaction to being the older person in the conversation.
