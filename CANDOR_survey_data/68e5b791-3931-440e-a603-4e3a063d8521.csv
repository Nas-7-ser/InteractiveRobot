I had a lovely day off and got a lot of chores done, which makes me feel able to tackle the week in peace, without feeling frazzled. It's a nice time of the year with regards to the weather, so it'll be nice to spend time outside, and I'm looking forward to some of the work assignments I have scheduled this week.","What worked well is that my conversation partner was very upbeat, energetic, intelligent, and had a great deal to contribute. She had a very interesting job and I was able to learn a lot about it. I appreciated how much she contributed, and the conversation flowed very naturally. We exchanged some useful information about sources of other opportunities like these, and compared notes on past experiences with them. I feel very fortunate to have encountered this person!","Honestly, nothing worked poorly in the conversation at all. She got to tell me a lot about her work experience through the pandemic, and I got to learn a lot about her industry. The conversation was slightly lopsided, with more attention paid to her work than mine, but that wasn't a problem for me at all--I would much rather hear about someone else's life than talk about mine!",9.0,9.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,7.0,7.0,1.0,35.0,65.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,8.0,8.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,2.0,5.0,,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,6.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,female,6.0,white,masters_degree,1.0,,8.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,54.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.5,5.333333333333333,,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,3.0,4.0,4.333333333333333,4.333333333333333,4.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,,

Tomorrow I'm planning on going to the beach since it's supposed to be 87 degrees(!!) and going to shop with an old gift card I found! I also promised myself as a reward for losing weight I could go buy some shorts I've been eyeing forever once I reached my goal, which I did yesterday, and the shorts are available at a store near the one I can use the gift card at.  I'll be working an event on Weds, Thurs, and Fri and I have Saturday off, which is exciting too.","My conversation partner opened with some set ""getting to know you"" questions about where I lived and what I did for a living. We had common ground in both having lived in Nevada in the past and I knew where the small town she lived in was.  The ""getting to know you"" questions easily led to a natural conversation flow, and she listened a lot to me.  I felt like I was talking about myself a lot but she seemed really interested!","I'm not sure there was anything that didn't work well!  The only thing I can think of is that I felt like I talked about myself a lot and didn't get a chance to learn a lot about her.  I did turn the conversation towards her once, but it was near the end of our time limit and I didn't get to hear more.
