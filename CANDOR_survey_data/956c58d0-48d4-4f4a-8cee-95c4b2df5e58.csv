We're both in caring professions that take unpaid internships, though thankfully mine will cost a lot less than hers. We seem to have had similar upbringings and value similar things. We had a good give and take, the conversation was rarely awkward.",I think I interrupted too much again. I should've paid more attention to her body language to make sure she was getting enough time to speak. I think I also spoke too fast; I need to work more on my pacing.

I am going on vacation next week what is keeping me excited as I have something to look forward to. It is very hot though and I am starting to feel annoyed at that but overall doing okay. I hope it cools down soon though. ,The flow of conversation went well. We did not have many gaps or awkward pauses. We both chatted and helped keep the conversation going. There were no technical issues and everything went pretty smoothly in terms of audio. I was very pleased with the experience and would do it again. ,Sometimes we spoke over eachother but that can happen and was not a big deal. There were some pauses but it wasnt too long. It can be awkward when you are trying to make conversation with a stranger but i feel we made it work and it was a good chat. ,7.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,8.0,8.0,7.0,50.0,50.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,7.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,female,2.0,white,bachelors_degree,2.0,,8.0,5.0,2.0,,False,,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.5,6.0,,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.3333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,2.3333333333333335,3.0,3.6666666666666665,4.333333333333333,4.0,2.3333333333333335,4.0,,
