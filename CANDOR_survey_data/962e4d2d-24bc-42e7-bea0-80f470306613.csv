She had actually done this chat before so knew a bit about how it was supposed to go down. And we both were cat lovers so shared photos of our cats and what they are like. Also we like Disney/Pixar movies,"It was a bit artificial - since we weren't provided any conversational prompts, we had to think of things to talk about which weren't too personal. We didn't even exchange names, I felt she didn't want to give up too much information about herself, which is totally fine by me!

Our common interests of animals and animated films also helped our conversation go well. We both took an interest in the other and tried to keep the conversation equal and balanced between us. All of these things helped.,It was hard to tell when the other person would begin or end their speaking. It can be difficult to interpret what other people are thinking and feeling over video chat as well.
