We discussed those issues and challenges almost entirely during the conversation. That was good to do though, because I haven't really had the opportunity to talk about those things with many other people. I liked that.",I think we both knew that we might not have as many other things in common besides that single topic of parenthood. She seemed a little older and also had two children of an older age than myself. She lived in Northern KY while I'm in a major urban area.
