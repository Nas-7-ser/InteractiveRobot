Football is this weekend, with some amazing playoff games.  I'll love watching them, as it's my favorite sport.  I'm hoping the Packers, 49ers, Ravens, and Chiefs win their games.

I'll also be at the gym tonight and tomorrow morning, which is important to me, as well as playing some tennis this weekend.  It'll be an active and successful rest of the week!","Several things worked well.  We went a little over our 25 minute time period so the conversation flowed well.  We had some things in common, she lived in Kentucky, and I used to.  I live in Florida, where she frequently visits and would like to move.  We had a good talk and told each other some things about ourselves and our interests ","Sometimes I feel I talk to much, and sometimes I feel like I interrupt when someone is talking.  I think this happens over video with me more so than in person, as sometimes I find it difficult to pick up on verbal and non verbal cues. I really hope I didn't come off as rude or insensitive.

It is going to be warm here so we may get to get out and do some cleaning up on the farm. We need to go to Tractor Supply and pick up some salt blocks. Hopefully we will get to Church on Sunday. I just hope it quits raining,"The young man I talked to reminded me of my 2 sons. He loves his family, he knows how to save money, and to make money. We had a lot in common, we both like to travel, we love visiting our State Parks. We both love Florida and fishing. He was very nice.","Well at first I was a bit shy, we had a slow start getting the conversation going, but after about 5 minutes I felt as if I were talking to one of my sons close friends.
