Then we talked about what this survey might be used for.",8.0,8.0,8.0,"Toward the end my chat partner and I talked a bit more about our personal lives, and how I have a two-year-old.

I have a couple of work and personal projects that I'm hoping to make some progress on. I lost daycare due to COVID this week so I see that as a potential emotional barrier as well as something that might prevent me from accomplishing as much as I'd like.,"We both had the same headphones, so it was an easy transition to begin conversation. I think my partner and I had a good give-and-take in terms of talking and listening, and we didn't run out of things to discuss. We found common ground (our headphones and talking about surveys) and easily transitioned to other topics.","Honestly I don't perceive that anything ""didn't work well"". If anything we could have chatted a good 25 minutes longer. My video lagged and I guess maybe I felt a little anxious after I was able to restore a connection, but the conversation after that incident went just as well as it had prior to the technical issue.",5.0,3.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,5.0,55.0,45.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,8.0,8.0,2.0,2.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,,1.0,4.0,5.0,,1.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,8.0,7.0,7.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,female,4.0,white,masters_degree,1.0,,8.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,29.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,3.0,6.0,7.0,2.3333333333333335,1.6666666666666667,28.0,7.0,0.0,9.0,5.0,48.0,3.3333333333333335,2.0,4.0,2.3333333333333335,2.0,3.0,4.333333333333333,4.333333333333333,2.0,3.6666666666666665,,
