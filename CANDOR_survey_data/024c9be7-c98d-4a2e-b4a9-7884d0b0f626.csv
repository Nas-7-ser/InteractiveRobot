At end of day on Friday I'm hoping I won't have to work again until after Thanksgiving, but that means I'll have a lot to do before then. Some late night and early mornings. Outside of work also have some chores to do around the house. Would also like to decorate for Christmas before I leave so it'll be festive when I get back. Little victories in 2020.","I think we got along well. We had some similar interests in sports and travelling. Also look at the current pandemic at least somewhat similarly. It was nice to hear about recent travels and things observed on those travels. Personally, it also nice to hear about Oregon doing well during the pandemic as its close to my heart.","We both pointed out how we try to avoid the constant influx of political talk in our everyday lives, yet we spent a big portion of that conversation discussing exactly that. Wouldn't say that didn't work well, but even when discussing sports, travel and family, the conversation went back to politics.

My previous week was really busy so it'll be nice to have some down time before the chaos of Thanksgiving. I also think the rest of my week will give me a lot of alone time, which I need, and the opportunity to catch up on household and work things. ","I think the conversation went really well in general! Right from the beginning we had plenty to talk about, which helped the conversation flow really nicely. I also think it helped that we had similar energy levels, which made the conversation progress naturally. Also, I would say this conversation had great transitions, even better than some of the other conversations I've had. ","Overall, I think everything worked pretty well in the conversation. It started really smoothly and also ended very naturally (which doesn't always happen with these things). The only that maybe didn't work 100% great was that we stuck to a limited number of topics. It worked out really well in this case, but sometimes that can make a conversation shorter!",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,8.0,8.0,5.0,50.0,50.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,8.0,8.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,1.0,5.0,,1.0,1.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,female,6.0,white,bachelors_degree,1.0,,6.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,21.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.75,6.0,,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,4.666666666666667,3.3333333333333335,4.666666666666667,2.3333333333333335,5.0,3.6666666666666665,2.3333333333333335,5.0,,
