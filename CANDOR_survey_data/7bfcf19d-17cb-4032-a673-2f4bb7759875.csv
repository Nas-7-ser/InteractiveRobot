My discussion partner was very interested in people and making things better yet was not an angry person. She was obviously very intelligent and had the confidence to express herself well. I could have talked much longer.,"I was self conscious about how I come across in a video. While I am talking to people for work throughout the day, I am not on video calls, thus do not see how I look when engaging.

She also talked about a trip to Nepal, and sharing photos with the children in the community outside of Dallas as some perspective on their lives. 

I forgot to mention that between the beginning and middle of the conversation, we talked about work and how millenials were taught to follow their dreams and about how that often translated to professional work. We discussed that that is not a practical way to run an economy, and we talked about how Americans work so many hours that their only chance to really follow their dreams often is through work, and how if we worked less and allowed for more leisure ,we might be able to have more fulfilled hobbies and overall lives.",5.0,7.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,7.0,7.0,6.0,95.0,4.0,85.0,90.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,1.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,7.0,9.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,7.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,7.0,7.0,6.0,8.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,7.0,5.0,"The rest of this week is going to be good.

I don't have many specific plans, but I will be hosting a very small (4 people) birthday wine tasting for one of my closest friends. ","Both Pam and I share some demographics. Despite our age difference, we are both white women from affluent backgrounds with lots of opportunity. That helped because we have similar social norms, and so our conversation began with basically no awkwardness. We also share a passion for helping people and have had experiences with people with less privilege than ourselves, so we have been humbled by those experiences.","There really wasn't much that didn't work. We both seemed to talk almost an equal amount, and I felt heard and understood by her as I think she did me. I didn't necessarily agree with 100% of what she said, but we were able to speak fairly honestly and openly for talking with a stranger.
