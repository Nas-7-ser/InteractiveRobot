I have a lot of good work lined up, so it should be productive.  I look forward to seeing my Mom again at the end of the week, after we drive down to Texas. It will be nice spending time with her.","I think that the fact that we are both parents, with kids the similar age, worked out well.  We also had caretaking our Mothers' in common.  That gave us something to bond over and talk about during our conversation. I had a lot of respect for what she had to say and what she went through. ","There were a few lulls in the conversation.  We are different races and genders, so there are some areas that I didn't want to use as conversation topics (the election).  I think she was probably a little wary of speaking to a white man, to be perfectly honest, and I can't say that I blame her.

We had a cool report and no need to be nervous. ,"I think those moments where you are like ok what to say next. Other than that there were no negatives. Like we were on the same page much. 
well maybe I was concerned about being political or saying the word blessing and ll. But with everything going on in the world right now this study makes it scary. but our conversation was positive.
