I can only get the blocks every 3 months and they only last a couple weeks. I can actually go out with my friends, go shopping, visit family, get in a decent workout, and pretty much do anything besides lie in bed and hope I'm put out of my misery.",The conversation was well fun and very captivating to both of us. We had fun and chat lots about lots of things in general. She was very funny and easy to chat with. she is well diverse in thoughts of life. I had lots of fun in the chat thanks,i don't see any thing wrong with the conversation i just had with her. i could hear her voice and she could hear mine also. we both saw each other. i think it has a nice interface and the chat went well in both sides of the conversation i just have,7.0,7.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,40.0,60.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,7.0,8.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,3.0,5.0,,1.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,male,2.0,white,bachelors_degree,1.0,,7.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,45.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.625,5.666666666666667,,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.3333333333333335,3.0,2.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,2.6666666666666665,2.6666666666666665,2.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,,

My college classes start Monday so I am a little stressed about that. I am also homeschooling my three children at this time so my plate is pretty full. I am also pretty tired I am thinking about sleeping or taking a nap after this survey :)","It was okay, I felt like I had to ask a lot of questions because my chat partner wasn't used to having random conversations. Larry, seemed nice but he also seemed like he wasn't good at carrying the conversation or to ask me many questions. I am a very chatty person, so I don't mind talking a lot. But, I worry that I don't give people enough time to talk between my talking.","I thought it was pretty one sided but, Larry didn't seem like a bad guy. Its just not going to be a very memorable chat because I felt like I had to dig a little for a response at times. I don't think I would personally seek out a conversation with Larry on my own as we have very little in common. But, I could see talking to him as a coworker at work while we pass time.
