He was very friendly and open to talk about whatever came up. Nothing felt forced, we just dove right into conversation like we knew each other very well. It was laidback and free flowing. No one really dominated the conversation and it was a good back and forth.","Honestly nothing bad to say other than the initial hiccup with the video and audio not connecting.

We didn't even introduce ourselves until the very end of the conversation, and that was just when we had realized we had been talking for over half an hour without knowing the other person's name.  We also had shared interests that helped support the rest of the conversation from then on.","There were a few moments where the conversation dipped as we exhausted the current topic.
