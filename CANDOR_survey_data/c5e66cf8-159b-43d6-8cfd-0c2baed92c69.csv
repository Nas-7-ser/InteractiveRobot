I will try to get as much stuff done at work as possible, but I can see this week being very busy. However, I think it will be a pretty good week overall. I just can't wait for the weekend.","My partner was good at keeping a conversation going, and he was good at coming up with topics to talk about. He was a science professor at a college, and I happen to like science, so it was pretty interesting to talk to him. One of the things we talked about is how yogurt is made, and I thought that was pretty interesting.","Honestly for some reason, today I wasn't really feeling it. I probably wasn't the best conversationalist today, and it was not really that easy to get a conversation going. Also, most of the topics we talked about weren't really that interesting, so I wasn't really interested in what was going on.",5.0,6.0,7.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,40.0,60.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,4.0,4.0,7.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,,,,4.0,25.0,,,3.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,male,4.0,asian,bachelors_degree,1.0,,8.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,30.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.125,5.0,,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.3333333333333335,4.666666666666667,2.0,1.6666666666666667,3.0,3.3333333333333335,4.0,3.3333333333333335,1.6666666666666667,3.6666666666666665,,

Hopefully another conversation through prolific. I will have to figure out some activities to do while watching the boy. I will try to post interesting videos for the courses I teach. I hope the weather stays nice. I will probably watch another movie or two. ,I think we both did our share of the talking. We had common interest in science and covid. We talked a lot about geography and shared some info on multiple topics. We were both friendly I think. I think he influenced my to tell little mini stories about inocuous topics. No one got embarrassed. ,"I think neither of us were really in the mood to take risks. Neither of us felt so passionately about something important that we really wanted to get into discussing it. We just stuck to common mundane topics and the whole conversation just felt like we were going through the motions just to do it. He is a really friendly smart guy and all, but there just wasn't the right dynamic to make it more interesting.
