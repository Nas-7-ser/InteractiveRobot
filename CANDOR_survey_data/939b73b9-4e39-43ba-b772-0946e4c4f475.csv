I imagine it will be challenging to balance work and life while caring for our toddler. It's been tough already and it is only Monday! I will have to work to be mindful this week.,"My partner was a kind person and helped open up the conversation by talking about his location and asking about mine. He asked questions when things slowed down, I think. He was overall a positive person with relevant news items to bring to the conversation. He also made sure to be on time.","I felt that it was kind of dull and that we talked quite a bit about things that I'm tired of talking about. We talked about geography and holiday plans, and about COVID, politics, and vaccines. I am not great at indicating when a topic is boring I think, so I probably didn't give great hints that the topics weren't that interesting to me.",5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,6.0,7.0,4.0,45.0,55.0,5.0,7.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,7.0,9.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,13.0,,,4.0,16.0,,,4.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,3.0,3.0,6.0,5.0,8.0,8.0,7.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,female,4.0,white,masters_degree,1.0,,9.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,29.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.875,5.666666666666667,,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.6666666666666665,2.0,3.6666666666666665,3.0,1.6666666666666667,3.6666666666666665,4.0,3.6666666666666665,2.0,3.0,,

We plan on trail hiking and biking, kayaking and spending some time taking photos of the area. It's really a trip to give us a chance to decompress from the Covid restrictions and issues. ","The conversation was just fine. She was very personable and charming, we were able to find things we have in common, politics being the one we spoke about the most. We're both Biden supporters and are hopeful that things will get back to normal and America will regain it's standing in the world. ",There really wasn't any aspect of the conversation that didn't work well. We started by introducing ourselves and then went into a conversation about where we live. It all seemed fluid and didn't need to be forced.
