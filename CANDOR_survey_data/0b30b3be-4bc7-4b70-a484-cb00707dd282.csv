I have a whole lot of nothing planned besides watching some NFL football and some UFC MMA. It has been a great week so i have high hopes for this weekend,It seemed to work well when we discussed Oregon's new law that passed that decriminalized drugs. We also discussed the cannabis industry and the different uses of cannabis oil. he seemed to understand and i am really knowledgeable on the subject so it was easy for him to understand what i was talking about.,The thing that didnt seem to work well was when we didnt really have anything to talk about for 10 seconds here or 20 seconds there. it felt incredibly awkward. i have done five of these so far and this one seemed to be the most difficult. i am not sure if it was him or me but the convo just did not seem smooth.,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,60.0,40.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,3.0,1.0,7.0,7.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,10.0,,,4.0,15.0,,,5.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,male,3.0,white,associate_degree,1.0,,8.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,45.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.75,4.333333333333333,,1.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.3333333333333335,1.3333333333333333,3.0,3.0,2.6666666666666665,2.3333333333333335,3.0,3.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,3.0,,

I plan on hopefully getting caught up on chores and re-starting my reading to take my certification test hopefully by the end of the month. I haven't read in a few nights and I really need to get back to that and not  slacking off. ,The conversation worked because as we discussed where we lived in our states I knew a little of his state and some recent news there so I was able to relate to him even more and little quicker because of that. We discussed where that news could go for his state and maybe opening up tourism and expanding industry which hopefully improves his area.,They seemed rushed to get off the call because they wanted to do the bare minimum of 25 minutes and be done. They did come prepared though to not have a lull in the conversations because he said he had a questionnaire ready to go with over 250+ questions so at least it would have had some conversation starters for sure. I didn't do any of that and just figure we'd ad-lib it to start.,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,50.0,50.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,2.0,,4.0,25.0,,,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,male,4.0,white,associate_degree,1.0,,6.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,38.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.25,5.0,,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.6666666666666665,3.0,3.6666666666666665,2.3333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,3.0,3.0,3.3333333333333335,3.0,,
