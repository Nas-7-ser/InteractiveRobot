These are very strange times and unfortunately I'm probably going to be facing a loss of my job soon due to the pandemic. I've been on furlough for the last several months and it sounds as if those will turn into permanent layoffs soon. I've been trying to get my act together when it comes to searching for jobs, but there aren't a lot of opportunities right now and it is rather stressful.","I think we were both very friendly and polite during the conversation. We discussed some serious issues but were respectful towards one another's views. The conversation felt like it might've started veering into uncomfortable territory regarding the Black Lives Matter movement at one point, but we were able to recover and move off the subject to something a little less incendiary. ","I think overall the conversation went well and there weren't too many issues. We may have disagreed on a few points without necessarily coming out to admit because you obviously want to keep something like this fairly cordial. I think we both have ideas about some issues in this country and generally agree that things need to change, but maybe don't line up eye to eye -- which is ultimately ok.",7.0,6.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,6.0,45.0,55.0,6.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,7.0,7.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,female,4.0,white,bachelors_degree,3.0,,7.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,30.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.75,5.666666666666667,2.0,1.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.3333333333333335,4.333333333333333,4.333333333333333,3.0,3.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,4.0,3.6666666666666665,2.3333333333333335,3.0,,

She was very talkative and added a lot of thought to the conversation which I appreciated- made me think about things in a way that maybe I hadn't before talking to her. ","What didn't work well was the fact that we for sure had different political views and when the discussion pointed out those differences, the tension got a bit thick and we both got a few digs in.
