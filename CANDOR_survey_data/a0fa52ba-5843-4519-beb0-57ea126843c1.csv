I am excited to head home to Pennsylvania for the holidays. It will be nice to have much needed time with my friends and family. I think the work week will go by quickly and I will be pretty busy throughout.,We both asked a lot of questions so that there was a lot to talk about. We were both open about our careers and families so it was not uncomfortable asking follow-up questions. We did an equal amount of talking so that one person was not dominating the conversation throughout.,When the video lagged sometimes we both spoke at the same time. There were several times when I started asking a question and could see that she was speaking but could not hear audio coming through. There were also moments of awkward pauses that we both tried to eliminate from happening.,5.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,8.0,3.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,55.0,45.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,2.0,2.0,7.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,6.0,,,4.0,11.0,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,female,4.0,white,masters_degree,1.0,,8.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,25.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.375,6.0,,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,4.666666666666667,4.666666666666667,1.3333333333333333,3.0,2.3333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,4.666666666666667,1.6666666666666667,3.0,,

This week I felt anxious, restless and unhappy. I hate to say it, but I don't see that changing a whole lot for the rest of the week which I assume means the next couple of days since today is the last day of this week.",I think we both discovered we have something in common that we could talk about such as living in a different region than where we grew up. We also worked or have worked in education so that was a something that worked well. She was a good listener and asked lots of questions and I tried to listen and ask as many questions. I also like to answer questions so i don't just give short answers.,"What  didn't work well was that I wasn't really in the mood to have a conversation so I was kind of forcing it . I also think that being strangers doesn't work well. Other than that, i probably could have spoken a bit slower and asked her more questions.
