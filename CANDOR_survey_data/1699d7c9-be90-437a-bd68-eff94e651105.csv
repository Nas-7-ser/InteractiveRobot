I am excited to finish up my remaining tasks and try to spend some time relaxing some of the last of the nice weather.,Both of us had a lot in common and we held similar views about topics. We were very respectful and took turns asking questions. We showed interest in one another's replies and it showed throughout the conversation. We also discussed a variety of topics that interested us both. We had a great deal in common.,"When the conversation first started, I was not sure what to talk about. I felt like there were times that I was talking much more than she was and I was worried that was annoying.

I want to go hiking with my husband and clean up our house. There's preparations to be made for the upcoming holidays. I do not want to be overwhelmed with things like I usually am so I must make a list to follow through with.,We both had some common ground and played off on those things. It helped that my partner was verbose in her answers and gave me lots of information to ask her about. I found she was easy to talk to and was a great conversationalist. One could say it is a form of free therapy.,"I can't really think of anything. I mean, there were some lulls but I think she was just as interested in the conversation as I was.
