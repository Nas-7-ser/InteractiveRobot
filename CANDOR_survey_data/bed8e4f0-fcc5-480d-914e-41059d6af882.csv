I have several zoom meetings scheduled but do not have any pressing projects that I need to accomplish. This week in my personal life I will focus on my fitness and health. I was also contemplating dying my hair and spending some time outdoors,"The conversation that I had with my partner worked well as we both initially discussed what were the expectations of the conversation. We started with easy small chat and familiarized ourselves to get to a comfortable level. Once we started chatting a bit and got to know our personalities, that is when the best parts of the conversation were able to happen",The initial part of our conversation was a bit awkward for the both of us as there were not predetermined speaking points or rules to what we could discuss. I was unsure if I could divulge what city I was in and how much personal information I could talk to her about.

We were both there for the same reason, so we figured we'd make it enjoyable.","It's hard to talk openly without sharing too many details about yourself.
