We also talked about music education and violins. He talked about his experience with violins. He also talked about how he has not left the house since March. ,9.0,8.0,8.0,In the middle we talked about our school experience. We talked about growing up poor and how Bill Gates had given money to our schools to try innovative things. We also discussed how people are not taking Covid seriously and how we want normalcy. We also talked about how much we like better up lab conversations. ,9.0,8.0,8.0,"We talked about how we want covid to be over and how we will appreciate things more when it gets back to normal. We talked about how our likes of cider and beer and we talked about frozen custard, I said that I enjoyed the conversation and wished him well in his coding career.

This is my last conversation so I am a little bummed about that. I have really enjoyed talking to new people and and sharing my thoughts. The weekend is upon us, and it will be good to have some time off. Next week we have Friday off so I am excited for a shorter work week. ",I think we both were looking for good conversation. We both had similar backgrounds with poverty and with social anxiety. We both listened to each other and had fun talking about our lives. It was very organic and real conversation. We avoided controversial topics so we could enjoy the conversation. He seemed very interested and had lots to say.  ,"I think the conversation went well. There wasn't really anything that went wrong, The topics are a little shallow, but it is very hard to have deep conversations with someone you just met. I wonder if we had a topic bank, if that might stimulate deeper conversations. On the other hand, it was a very pleasant conversation.

We also talked about how our areas are coping with covid and social distance protocol,8.0,7.0,8.0,At the end we talked about how Wisconsin has some of the highest covid rates in the country due to people pretneding it doesn't exist.

Tomorrow I will go to the farmers market to pick up my CSA share of veggies and meat. Usually after that I stop and pick up any other groceries I need. We have my partners 9 year old for the next week so we will probably just spend sunday hanging out and getting ready for the school/work week,","I think the thing that worked the most about the conversation was finding common ground. While I am not a daily classroom teacher, I have taught in a public school setting in the past. This allowed for a common ground to start a conversation. We also both have kids and could talk about how they are coping with the covid related changes to school.",I felt like the conversation went pretty smoothly. I am introverted and pretty awkward typically so that was definitely a factor. But as soon as we learned that we both teach and have kids it was a lot easier to find conversation material. I was especially nervous when I saw that my conversation partner was a guy. I typically get along better with women and non binary folks.,5.0,6.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,8.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,8.0,8.0,6.0,40.0,60.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,,2.0,,2.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,other_or_prefer_not_to_answer,6.0,white,bachelors_degree,3.0,,8.0,9.0,2.0,,False,,,35.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.125,6.0,,1.6666666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.3333333333333335,4.333333333333333,2.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,4.0,4.333333333333333,4.0,2.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,,
