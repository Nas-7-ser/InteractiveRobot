It will mostly involve studying and getting assignments done as well as going to the gym. I hope to get out more as I have been stuck in the house for awhile. All of the weeks seem to blend together at this point. ,The flow of the conversation went well in which we kept bringing up topics to speak on and it went smoothly. I felt that the 25 minutes went by pretty quickly and there werent many awkward pauses throughout. We had things in common as well which made it that much easier. ,The video and audio was not an issue. There wasnt much that didnt go well other than a couple of awkward pauses but it was not bad at all and we managed to keep the conversation going. Overall I very much enjoyed talking to my partner and it went great.,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,8.0,8.0,4.0,60.0,40.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,1.0,5.0,,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,female,4.0,white,bachelors_degree,2.0,,6.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,25.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.625,6.0,,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.6666666666666665,4.666666666666667,4.0,2.3333333333333335,3.0,2.6666666666666665,4.333333333333333,4.0,2.0,4.0,,

Also about COVID and how our experience is ",5.0,5.0,5.0,We talked about Makeup and makeup personalities jeffree Star and James Charles. We also discussed setting spray and how it doesn’t work for either of us but that maybe stage grade spray could work.,6.0,6.0,5.0,We talked a little bit about music and that we both dislike country music.

I don’t have anything huge planned and am focused on getting work and tasks done. I think that because of this it may be a little repetitive but it will be tolerable although not amazing. It may also be. Al little sad since I have to go to a funeral later in the week but since I’ve already processed the grief I don’t think it will make much more of an impact on my mood the rest of the week. ,Since we were in the same age group talking to her was incredibly easy. Even though I have enjoyed conversations with other participants before it felt like it took effort but the 25 minutes flew by when I was talking to her. We both shared similar views and feelings on the subjects we discussed so there was not any friction. ,"We had trouble knowing whose turn it was. Sometimes it was hard to tell when she was and was not done with a thought so I might accidentally interrupt her or something. There were also some awkward pauses because of me trying to avoid interrupting her, or because even though we had things to talk about and we had things in common we had to find a way to continue the conversation.",3.0,4.0,6.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,53.0,47.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,8.0,8.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,4.0,5.0,,1.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,female,3.0,white,some_college,7.0,Student ,5.5,6.0,2.0,,False,,,19.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.5,6.0,,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.3333333333333335,4.0,2.0,4.333333333333333,4.0,2.3333333333333335,4.333333333333333,3.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,3.0,,
