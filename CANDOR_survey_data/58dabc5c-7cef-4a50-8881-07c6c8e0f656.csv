Then it's a 3-day weekend since Memorial Day is Monday so I'm excited to have some time off from work.  I have a final assignment due for grad school on Sunday which I'll try to finish today so that I can fully enjoy the weekend.  I hope there's nice weather so I can spend time outside.,"My conversation partner was engaging and we had things in common.  We both grew  up in the Northeast, like socializing with friends, like travelling, graduated from college within the past 5 years, and like living in cities.  She's considering moving to NYC and I got to give her advice about the apartment search which I hope was useful for her.",There weren't really any negative parts of the conversation and there was only about one moment where there was kind of a pause and I had to think about a new question to resume the conversation.  My conversation partner was social and engaging which made it easy to converse with her.,4.0,8.0,2.0,5.0,8.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,4.0,7.0,7.0,3.0,60.0,40.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,6.0,7.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,2.0,,4.0,25.0,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,female,4.0,mixed,bachelors_degree,1.0,,8.0,9.0,2.0,,False,,,27.0,5.0,,0.0,30.0,0.0,70.0,0.0,30.0,0.0,70.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.25,6.0,1.0,1.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,3.0,4.666666666666667,2.0,4.666666666666667,4.0,4.333333333333333,3.3333333333333335,1.6666666666666667,4.0,work_colleagues,phone_call

I do not have much planned as I am in quarantine. I hope to have a video chat with some of my friends and watch the new season of a show I like on Netflix. I am anticipating the reopening of my state and am curious to see how it will play out because I am choosing to continue quarantining.,"My partner was from a neighboring state, so it was nice to find a commonality between us right off the bat. She was also close to my age. It was easy to talk about our current situation since everyone is in quarantine, but everyone is having a unique experience, so being able to share our quarantine experience worked well and gave us a starting point for the conversation.","What didn't work well was the fact that we knew nothing about each other going into the conversation, so there were some awkward pauses where we weren't sure what to talk about. Our personalities were kind of different, so you couldn't easily tell what things we might have in common.
