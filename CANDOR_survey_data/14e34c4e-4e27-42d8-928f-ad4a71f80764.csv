I am concerned about exposure to COVID-19 and I think that the etest itself will be uncomfortable. So, I think that the start of the week ahead after this day will be filled with anxiety and then a nagging fear that I could have been exposed to a potentially deadly virus will continue for up to two weeks after that. I think I'll go about my normal life (cooking, cleaning, writing, etc.) for the most part except for that anxiety. I also am looking forward to the holiday ahead and my husband being home more than usual.","I think that my conversation partner responded well to my questions, but showed little interest in me or my life. She asked me no questions and I could see in her eyes that she was checking out when I spoke about myself. So, I think that her replies to my questions worked well toward giving me the ability to ask follow-up questions. ","As I said before, my partner clearly wasn't interested in me or my life. I think she either wasn't interested in me because of our age difference, or she's only doing these conversations for the payment and not really to engage with the other person. I felt that her social skills were more oriented toward talking about herself than learning about other people.
