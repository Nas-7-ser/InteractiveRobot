It is the weekend and I have done most of the chores that I needed to get done this weekend so I should be able to spend the rest of the week relaxing and enjoying time with my family. ,My partner was really good about coming up with things to talk about. There was never a dull moment in the conversation because she always had something new to talk about. It was also nice that we didn't have to come up with a lot of topics to talk about we were able to expound on a few topics. ,I don't feel like we had the same opinions on certain things. It made the conversation kind of stop and go because I could tell how she felt about a topic so I would kind of skirt the issue to not offend but that made it so that I didn't have much to add about a few of the things we talked about. ,6.0,7.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,8.0,7.0,7.0,30.0,70.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,7.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,23.0,,,4.0,20.0,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,6.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,7.0,5.0,7.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,male,1.0,white,bachelors_degree,1.0,,8.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,29.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.875,5.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.6666666666666665,5.0,5.0,1.0,3.6666666666666665,4.333333333333333,4.333333333333333,4.0,2.0,4.0,,
