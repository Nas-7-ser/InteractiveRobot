I noticed she had a cat.  It was just basic introductions.,9.0,7.0,9.0,We talked about the fact that my husband and her best friend had submarines in common.  Her best friend is currently stationed where my husband was stationed when he was on a submarine.  We talked about where she was from and how far it was from where she is attending med school.  I told her where I went to college and about how I studied psychology and counseling there but ended up in a completely different career.,9.0,8.0,9.0,We talked about how her med school does A&P labs differently than other med school labs in that they're virtual. She told me about how realistic it seemed and how certain parts in the body could be color coded so the students could easily tell what they were supposed to be looking at.  I told her a story about my best friend's experience when she had a cadaver lab years ago.  She told me her dad was an OB/GYN which is why she's always been interested in being one herself.,9.0,6.0,9.0,8.0,9.0,7.0,7.0,6.0,85.0,3.0,90.0,75.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,1.0,9.0,7.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,7.0,6.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,7.0,8.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,7.0,8.0,9.0,9.0,8.0,8.0,"I think the rest of my week will be good, but busy.  My parents are coming to visit tomorrow and staying for the rest of the weekend so it will be nice to get some quality time with them.  We'll go see my daughter cheer at a game tomorrow evening and then the rest of the weekend we're going to try to get some things done around the house, watch college football, shop, and hopefully do some bike riding as well.",We were able to find a few things in each of our lives that had a common thread to them.  She's in medical school and my best friend is a doctor.  Her best friend is currently on a submarine.  My husband was a submarine officer.  With those shared close connections it was easy to make conversation flow.,"I really felt like everything worked well.  There were just a couple of short pauses in the conversation where I think both of us were trying to think of what to say next, but they were quick and one of us would think of another question to ask and the conversation immediately picked back up with ease.
