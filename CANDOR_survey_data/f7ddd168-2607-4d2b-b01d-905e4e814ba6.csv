I had to really turn up my volume to hear. The picture was a little cloudy  and I had been in a hurry to make on time so I was a little flustered but worked out the quirks pretty quickly. ",7.0,7.0,9.0,"Well, we were telling each other of our home and the general feel of that , I was asked about what I did for fun and mentioned I was flying so my fun had ended.

This has been a really weird day as things haven't been smooth, but they seem to have worked out their own wrinkles. I feel im on the edge of the cliff but holding on just the same. I had a issue with my credit union and it worked to my advantage, but my pressure cooker would build any pressure. ( ironic ) yes.
So I would like less drama, and more nothingness. ",I think I had carried a lot of it cause he seems more introverted than I. Then again maybe Im so extroverted I didn't give him much of a chance.  The last chat buddy I had seemed so much more on my intel level but it could be life's influence too. the age gap wasn't that wide but I've always had better gabs with people my senior.   ,"We were from two different background apparently. I think Michigan is a lot , I mean a lot more conservative than my west coast affiliation. He was a father, I have no children, and a salesman of office furniture gave me little to find a creative streak. 
Just a more conservative type than me. I think I amused  him though.

After that I'm going to probably be mentally drained and pretty much worthless the rest of the week.,"There was a 3 second lag on my audio to her.  She was fine to me.  This caused the conversation to be unbalanced towards her.  I tried to keep up and provide good listening, but I think the lag didn't allow her  to get my feedback in timely enough manner for her to react.  Also, I think she kind of likes to monologue a bit anyway.","Audio lag was the big issue.  I had a hard time getting my response back to her in time.  She didn't seemed as bothered by it as it it allow her to control the conversation.  I would have liked to contribute more.
