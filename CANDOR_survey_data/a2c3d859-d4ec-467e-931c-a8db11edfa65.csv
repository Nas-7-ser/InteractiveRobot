I returned from a week's vacation and I am anxious to get back into my routine.  I need to concentrate on my diet and exercise more which I did not do on vacation.  I want to get out and play pickleball on a daily basis as I did a few weeks ago.,I felt as though I was the one to start the conversation and switch to other topics.  I thought she seemed a little timid and shy but not unfriendly.  She reminded me of my daughter and I'm not sure if that made it awkward or not.  I seemed to be the one to carry most of the conversation although she did ask me some questions.,I felt as though I was the more aggressive person in the conversation.  I kept the conversation going and came up with the topics we would talked about.  I feel as though I offered more personal information than she did.  She seemed to be interested in knowing more about my daughter's field work she is doing right now because it is something she might be interested in at some point.  ,5.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,7.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,8.0,2.0,65.0,35.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,9.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,,2.0,,4.0,20.0,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,8.0,9.0,7.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,female,2.0,white,some_college,5.0,,8.0,7.5,2.0,,False,,,60.0,8.0,,50.0,25.0,25.0,0.0,0.0,75.0,20.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.625,5.333333333333333,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.333333333333333,4.666666666666667,3.0,1.6666666666666667,3.6666666666666665,3.0,4.666666666666667,4.666666666666667,2.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,family,in_person

This consists of trying to cure my boredom and pass the time by watching shows, browsing the internet, listening to music, and working on my hobbies.","We were both warm and friendly towards each other and asked questions about each other and our lives. There were no awkward silences and the conversation flowed pretty smoothly. Both our connections were working well and we encountered no microphone, camera, or internet issues except for when I accidentally clicked on one of my bookmarked links.","I feel that I didn't talk as much and although we had no awkward silences, I still felt awkward on my end because it's hard for me to talk and be a good conversationalist when I'm not physically with the person I'm talking to.
