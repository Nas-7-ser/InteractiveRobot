Although I haven't been as productive as I would like I feel positive about the goals I've set for myself. I'm planning on meeting my sister and niece to go blueberry picking tomorrow. Looking forward to an outdoor activity where we can safely be together.,She was a good chat partner who had a very different life from myself but that made it interesting to ask questions of her and let her tell me about herself. She was friendly and warm and with a few questions I could tell that we would have many common interests and viewpoints. She managed the back and forth in the conversation well despite her stated nerves at the beginning and warmed up quickly.,I don't think there was anything lacking in our conversation. I could have easily spent more time talking to her but didn't want her to feel uncomfortable by extending it too long. She easily shared details and interesting facts each time I asked her a question. I didn't feel she asked too many questions of me but I don't really worry about that in a conversation because I feel like I can keep the conversation moving forward without having direct questions asked of me.,5.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,7.0,7.0,1.0,50.0,50.0,7.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,5.0,9.0,9.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,3.0,5.0,,1.0,3.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,6.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,female,6.0,white,bachelors_degree,1.0,,8.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,53.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6.125,6.0,,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.3333333333333335,5.0,2.0,3.6666666666666665,3.0,3.0,5.0,3.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,4.0,,

I'm going to do some stressful things, but I'll also have nice moments of solitude and get to spend time with my family. I also get some time away from my roommates, and since they have gotten on my nerves recently, it'll be nice to have some time apart and reconnect in a positive way later.","I think the reason it worked well was that my conversation partner seemed to be a talkative extroverted person that could keep conversations going very well. I definitely struggle with talking to strangers, so I was lucky to be paired up with someone like her. we also had a lot in common ideology-wise.","It was overall a very successful conversation, but the moments I felt less great were mostly because I am an awkward person and I can get pretty down on myself when I feel like I'm being boring or weird. However, this wasn't that big of an issue because it didn't seem like my conversation partner cared that much.",7.0,3.0,7.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,35.0,65.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,20.0,,,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,8.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,female,6.0,white,some_college,3.0,,9.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,21.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.5,6.0,3.0,1.6666666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.3333333333333333,4.0,2.6666666666666665,4.333333333333333,3.3333333333333335,4.666666666666667,4.666666666666667,3.3333333333333335,3.0,4.0,,
