While I am a person who takes one day at a time, I see the rest of the week going well.  I definitely will be following up on the information my chat partner provided regarding income opportunities. It's always good to hear what income making websites work or don't work from other people.",I think it worked well because we both work with Prolific and we also make money with other sites and so it was a lot of fun to share information on what sites we liked and what sites we didn't.  I also felt we were similar in that we were both taking care of ailing family members.,I can't really think of anything that was bad with the conversation at all.  It would have been nice if we had the opportunity to talk longer than what we did. I think it was tremendous amount of fun.

I've been really enjoying the conversations that I've been having with my Prolific Partners, and look forward to meeting more interesting people throughout the week. It's been really great overall. ","During the beginning of the conversation, there may have been a bit of awkwardness during the feeling out process.  I could also sense that my partner was a little reluctant to share information with me, which I totally understand - you can never be too careful nowadays. However, the awkwardness soon passed. ","The only thing that didn't go well (during the beginning of the conversation) is that my partner's face was somewhat blurred on the screen, and I had a little trouble hearing her voice.  She mentioned that she experienced a few minor issues with her computer system when she initially logged in (the issues soon passed).",4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,50.0,50.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,,2.0,,4.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,male,4.0,black_or_african_american,some_college,1.0,,7.0,6.0,2.0,,False,,,56.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.25,6.0,,1.6666666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,1.6666666666666667,4.333333333333333,4.0,4.333333333333333,4.333333333333333,2.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,,
