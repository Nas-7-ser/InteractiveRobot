Overall I am very condifendt my week will be very good. I have learned to not judge others or to also to not take anything personal, therefore I am always optimistic and happy, even if someone might try to make me feel any other way. ","I asked questions, and in a point in time, it felt like I forgoten about the time and we talked alot, and ejoyed it too, we lauigh many times, we smile, was a very good and itneresting conversation. It was not life changing, it was very casual but it felt very good and condortable. overall was a very good experience!!! ","What did not work was that I interrpted my partner a few times, but it was good too, because she did express her self very well, and she did too talked alot.

I don't have any activities that are annoying (unlike this week with the dentist twice).  I am hoping that the cooler weather continues as is without getting too cold so I can keep taking talks in sneakers and a sweater. I think it should be a pretty good week overall. I hope anyway.,"He was a good listener and had diverse thoughts about a lot of different things. It is always fun to speak with someone with a different background than me. While I have been to Venezuela, I have not met an American Immigrant from there, so that was fun to hear about.  He also didn't jump to conclusions about me which I really appreciated.","The conversation worked really well overall. I am always aware that my internal instinct is to speak out loud when I have a thought, which results in interrupting, so I had to consciously temper that, as I do with most people.  This is mostly a problem when I am really interested and engaged, because I am thinking more about what I am saying. So I spent some time trying to listen and keep what I wanted to say in my head at the same time, which means I am not listening as well.",7.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,5.0,50.0,50.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,7.0,7.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,female,4.0,white,masters_degree,1.0,,6.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,37.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.625,6.0,,1.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.6666666666666665,4.0,5.0,1.6666666666666667,4.333333333333333,4.333333333333333,3.3333333333333335,4.666666666666667,1.3333333333333333,4.333333333333333,,
