When I don't know someone well, I prefer to do most of the listening during a conversation. I did find it interesting discussing the differences in our personality traits as well, despite the differences in interests. ","What didn't work well was the differences between us. For example, she was a 50-year-old woman from Texas and I am a 27-year-old man from New York. She is in a different place in her life, and also has hobbies that differ from my own.

We discovered that he lives very close to my parents on the east coast. I enjoyed that he started asking questions about tv watching.
