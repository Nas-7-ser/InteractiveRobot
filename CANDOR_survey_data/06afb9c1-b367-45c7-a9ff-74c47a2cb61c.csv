I think that it is so nice to connect with othhers and see the similiarties.  It makes us feel not so alone in this pandemic to see that we share things with people from all over the country.  I like her.,I think everything went well.  We really flowed together and had many of the same interests and man commonalities.  We were both rather outspoken and had no problem saying what we were feeling.  I really like people who are real.  I don't like people who put on a show.  We did well.,"There was nothing that did not work well.  The video and audio were very good.  We both led and both followed and we did not interrupt each other.  We both had interesting things to share about life and our interests.  Overall, I liked her and would like to keep contact ",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,5.0,50.0,50.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,female,6.0,white,masters_degree,1.0,,8.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,52.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6.0,6.0,,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.6666666666666665,3.0,2.6666666666666665,2.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,3.0,3.3333333333333335,3.0,3.0,3.0,,

Her and I connected on several levels that are the basis for finding a great friend.  Will be talking to her a couple times this week to see how she is doing and chat again.  The chat left me uplifted and ready to start my day with a smile on my face.,"When the chat started I started talking and asking questions, then the conversation just started to flow.  We laughed a lot and got to know each other very well.  I was not afraid to give my information so that we can keep in touch with each other.  Think we will be friends for life, at least I hope so.  We laughed a lot.",We did have one lull in the conversation but as then I asked her about family and then the conversation started to flow again.  Really liked talking to her and didn't realize how lonely I had become.  Time to start opening up to people and not being afraid of getting hurt.,5.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,9.0,4.0,70.0,30.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,3.0,3.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,,1.0,4.0,5.0,,1.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,7.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,female,6.0,white,completed_high_school,4.0,,9.0,4.0,2.0,,False,,,60.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6.25,7.0,,1.6666666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.3333333333333333,4.0,2.3333333333333335,4.333333333333333,3.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,1.6666666666666667,5.0,,
