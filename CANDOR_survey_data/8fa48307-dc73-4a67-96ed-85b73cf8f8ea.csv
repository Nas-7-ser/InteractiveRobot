Then we discussed what our hobbies were. We both enjoyed sports, and my chat partner talked about flight simulators, which I was interested in learning more about, so my chat partner spoke of that in more detail.  ",9.0,7.0,9.0,"My chat partner and I spoke about how many siblings we have and the age gap between our respective families (my siblings being close in age, his being further apart). Then we spoke of where we lived in the US. My chat partner lived in Idaho currently, and spoke of how he traveled a lot, and lives in a mostly small town-ish. I spoke about how I lived in New York, and lived here my own life, so we spoke of our opposite experiences. ",9.0,8.0,9.0,"We spoke about religion, and how God played an impact in my chat partner's life. My chat partner has endured hardships and attributes his ability to live how he does to God's grace. We then spoke of how organized religion might be a roadblock to people today having a relationship with God. Finally, my chat partner asked of what I do for a living and how it was almost the opposite of what a previous chat partner of his did for a living, so we shared a laugh over that and concluded with speaking of the merits of this experiment, regarding meeting new people.

It being fair weather, I will probably go on some walks everyday for health, and then at night be together with my girlfriend to enjoy television, sports and video games. On Saturday it is my mother's birthday so we will travel to her home and enjoy a dinner at a restaurant after. ","My chat partner was very light-hearted, which made him easy to speak with. Also his personal experiences were far different than my own, and though the conversation was short, I felt like we were old friends. My chat partner was also enthused in his interests and easy to make laugh, which is always nice. ","Nothing specifically comes to mind in terms of negative moments in the conversation. My chat partner spoke of religion, but not in a pushy way, and I can see where that can potentially cause some strife, as that topic can get heavy, I didn't feel any type of way speaking about religion, but I didn't get my precise personal views on the subject.

We then talked about what each other does for fun specifically talking about simulators and video games and movies etc.,9.0,9.0,8.0,"We talked about religion and where each other stood on the belief in God. We also talked about how much churches seem to dissuade people from believing in God. This, we said, was primarily because they are more concerned about the organization of the church rather than the belief in God himself. We also talked about where Dan was from and the differences between the boroughs of New York.",9.0,9.0,8.0,"We talked about how he was a public defender and that he felt his job was very important.

However, I do have some which will be enough to keep my week interesting and somewhat eventful. For the most part, I am going to try and stay positive and upbeat throughout this week.","For me, there were a lot of things that worked well in this conversation. We were both actively engaged. We both were interested in the other person, and we both have enough to say to make the conversation interesting for the entire length of time. Overall, I was very pleased.","I think if there were anything that did not work well in the conversation it would be that I talked too much.
