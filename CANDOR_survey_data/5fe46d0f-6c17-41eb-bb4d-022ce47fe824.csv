I don't feel much motivation to continue on, and I feel extremely depressed. I'm hoping that things will get better, but I' pessimistic of all that's happened in my life over the past few weeks. Overall, I see it going the same as this week. ","What worked well in the conversation was that my partner and I had a lot in common. She was very patient, and she paused and waited to listen to my side of the story. We shared a lot in common, and I felt like she was really understanding of me. She wasn't judgmental either. ","At times I felt like I was nervous and searching my brain for things to talk about. I was also anxious socially, as to when the conversation would end. I was afraid that my partner might just not show up, and I was also afraid that she would end the chat early.

I'm not excited for the car ride, but I think it will be worth it. ",We both seemed to be currently in a place of struggle. We were able to open up and share about the tough things we are experiencing and feeling. We both seemed willing to listen to each other's stories and offer compassion. We didn't seem to struggle to come up with words to say often. ,"I would not say there was much that didn't work well. Perhaps we didn't have enough time to fully get into the context of our stories.
