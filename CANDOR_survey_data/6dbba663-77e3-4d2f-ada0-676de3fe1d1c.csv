I think it will be fine as long as I let myself relax. I really think that people get frustrated for small reasons that can at first be overwhelming. I think I will try and not let people or things get to me.,"I think I had a great conversation and it was especially enjoyable because the person I spoke with was a psychology student like I was. I think this gave us more things to talk about. The person was also easy to talk with and had a friendly disposition/ I think that there are so many things going on in our society today that can be a topic to talk about, like things related to the pandemic.",I feel as though nothing did work out. I can say that there is nothing in the conversation that I had that was negative. I think my partner would agree with me about this. I was able to have a nice conversation and no complaints.

She was really friendly and easy to talk to and seemed genuinely interested in what I had to say. It was funny seeing her husband in the background and nice to hear stories about her family (except for her one family member who got sick).,"She would often interrupt me before I finished what I was going to say, but honestly I preferred it when she did the talking so I didn't mind too much. Otherwise, I thought the conversation went well.
