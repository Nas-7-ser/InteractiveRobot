I mean working throughout the day time and then relaxing and some entertainment in the evening. Mostly watching an entertaining show on TV. Perhaps another trip to the grocery store is also necessary some time later in the week.,"The conversation worked out well, but it was slow to start. We both didn't seem to know what to say. But once we started a quite pleasant conversation was possible. It was interesting to hear about the education experiences my chat partner has currently to go through. We also discovered that we both almost have the same first name, which was kind of funny.",There were several moments when there was a bit of silence. We seem to have a hard time to find something to talk about. But once one side started on something it went pretty well. That happened several times during the conversation. The video quality of my partner wasn't that great. Sometimes the video lagged a little bit. And it was very blurry at times.,4.0,5.0,6.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,55.0,45.0,6.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,8.0,8.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,12.0,,,4.0,16.0,,,2.0,3.0,4.0,6.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,male,4.0,white,some_college,1.0,,5.5,7.5,2.0,,False,,,53.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.5,6.0,,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.3333333333333333,4.333333333333333,3.3333333333333335,2.0,3.6666666666666665,1.6666666666666667,4.666666666666667,4.0,2.0,4.0,,

I really don't have much planned but I like taking one day at a time and deciding what to do day-of. I like being outside so sometimes I just sit outside or take a walk to refresh my perspective and think of doing new things.,"My conversation partner, Andres, gave a lot of thought to each answer he gave to my questions and seemed to open up more as the conversation went on. He seemed genuinely interested in what I had to say and laughed and smiled and commented on the things I was saying.",What didn't work as well was that Andres didn't ask me as many questions as I asked him. There were quite a few pauses where it would have been acceptable for him to ask me a question about myself but instead I either offered up information about myself or I just asked him another question instead.,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,6.0,4.0,7.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,6.0,1.0,35.0,65.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,7.0,7.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,10.0,,,4.0,15.0,,,5.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,8.0,8.0,7.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,female,4.0,white,masters_degree,2.0,,9.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,24.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.0,6.0,,2.3333333333333335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,4.666666666666667,5.0,1.3333333333333333,4.333333333333333,1.6666666666666667,5.0,5.0,2.6666666666666665,4.333333333333333,,
