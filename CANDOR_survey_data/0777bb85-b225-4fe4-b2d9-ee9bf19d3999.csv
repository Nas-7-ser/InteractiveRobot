I anticipate that I will be busy as usual with work during the weekdays, but I'll be sure to set aside some time to take a break. Without repeating myself from the last survey, I do plan on voting this week as well which is something I look forward to.","I think we both came to the conversation with different strengths—my conversation partner was very intellectual and seemed to have a lot of knowledge on a wide array of topics, which provided for interesting material. On the other hand, I think I was a very good listener and knew when and how to engage positively in the conversation.","I do think the fact that we came from very different backgrounds did make it a little difficult to find common ground. For example, he's from New York, I'm from California, he's many years out of college and has an established career whereas I'm still a student, etc. That being said, it was interesting to be engaging with someone of a demographic that I likely would not have much interaction with at this stage in my life.",3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,8.0,7.0,7.0,30.0,70.0,6.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,7.0,9.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,25.0,,,5.0,,1.0,2.0,3.0,6.0,5.0,7.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,8.0,8.0,9.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,male,4.0,white,some_college,1.0,,9.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,21.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.75,5.333333333333333,,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.3333333333333335,4.666666666666667,2.6666666666666665,5.0,4.333333333333333,3.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,3.0,4.333333333333333,,

(he was surprised I knew about the Salton Sea when most people around him in California have no clue.)

I squared away a bunch of outstanding returns this weekend, but still have a good two or three big ones to get out of the way that will probably eat up a good portion of the next couple of days.  Beyond that, I have an important phone call tomorrow about a VERY irritating real estate deal in Brighton Beach.","He seemed interested in what I was saying.  I reckon we're both good listeners, so that helped.  But I do feel like I did a lot more of the talking and him more of the listening.  That said, I believe he was listening and was generally interested and friendly.  I figure we're both nice guys ultimately and just got along, even if we didn't have a whole lot in common.","So we don't have a whole lot in common.  He's a west coast guy and I'm very much not.  He's in college; I'm a 34 year old lawyer-CPA who's been in private practice for 8 years.  There's a gulf there.  So finding stuff to talk about was a little bit harder as there was something of an informational imbalance owing to our different stations in life (basically, I'm a decade plus older, so I'm just going to generally have more experience).",4.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,7.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,60.0,40.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,2.0,,4.0,25.0,,,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,7.0,5.0,8.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,male,2.0,white,professional_degree,1.0,,6.33,6.5,2.0,,False,,,34.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.125,5.0,,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,2.6666666666666665,4.0,2.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,3.0,2.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,,
