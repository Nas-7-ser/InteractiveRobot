We also talked about the pros and cons of working remotely as opposed to working in an office space. We talked about how we preferred the freedom of working from home.,7.0,7.0,7.0,We talked about COVID-19 and the risks it poses to people. The conversation then turned to exercising and how we navigate that in light of gym closures. I mentioned the workout equipment I have been using and he mentioned creative ways he had been working out.,6.0,5.0,8.0,"Toward the end of the conversation, the conversation got more technical. We talked about different technologies we use, such as phones and tablets. I mentioned how I am buying a new Amazon tablet but that I prefer Android devices in terms of smart phones. The conversation then shifted to the technicalities of his work as a nuclear engineer, including how they derive their computing power and the risks of the job. He talked about a new plant opening up as well.

I have to wake up early tomorrow to drive to PA to have a meeting with a customer contacts regarding the install of an inventory management system. Following this, I have some reporting I have to catch up on. My day will certainly be jam-packed. This weekend, I have to work at my part-time job both days as well. Those will be 8 hour shifts, so I imagine I will be very tired after coming home every day for the rest of the week.","I think the conversation flowed well because we are similarly aged males with an overlap in experiences. For example, both experienced a change to our working conditions because of COVID and we both had to adjust our workout routines to account for the restrictions. Furthermore, we both take an interest in talking about modern technology. I also enjoyed listening to his work as a nuclear engineer.","Fortunately, there is not a whole lot that didn't work well. The only limiting factor to our conversation was the differences in our expertise. As a nuclear scientist, that topic is more understandable to him than myself. Once he started getting nuanced in his explanations, I did not have a whole lot to say in return. However, I still found the topic interesting and was able to wrap my mind around what he was saying on some level.",7.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,8.0,7.0,4.0,35.0,65.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,7.0,8.0,2.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,1.0,5.0,,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,male,4.0,white,bachelors_degree,1.0,,7.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,28.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,5.125,6.0,1.3333333333333333,1.0,27.0,11.0,7.0,7.0,6.0,34.0,3.0,3.6666666666666665,4.333333333333333,3.3333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,4.0,3.6666666666666665,2.0,4.666666666666667,,

I would be working on some projects that I am currently handling and will be working from the office (with all the PPEs). I would also be exercising for the rest of the week after work to keep a healthy and fit body.  ,I think our similar age had a lot to do with that. The conversation worked as we are tech savvy people and we found common love for all things tech. We also were feeding off of each other's energy and were very interested to know what the other's person's point of view was. ,"The majority of the conversation focused on the current pandemic situation and how it was affecting everyone's life. I think we dwelled on that topic a lot more than necessary.  I guess since both of us have been in our homes for a while, that was the one common thread that we had and we just spent a lot of time talking about it.",2.0,4.0,8.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,8.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,8.0,8.0,7.0,9.0,2.0,60.0,40.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,25.0,,,4.0,25.0,,,6.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,male,4.0,asian,masters_degree,1.0,,8.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,32.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.125,7.0,1.0,1.0,29.0,14.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,23.0,4.666666666666667,4.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,3.6666666666666665,4.666666666666667,5.0,2.6666666666666665,4.666666666666667,,
