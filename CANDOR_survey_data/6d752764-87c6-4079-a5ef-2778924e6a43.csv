We then talked about our prior experiences doing the online video chat study - this my was partner's second time and my fourth time.,8.0,9.0,9.0,The middle of the conversation was mostly about the areas in which we lived and how life was. We also spoke of our experiences growing up since we were not too far apart in age.,9.0,9.0,9.0,Towards the end we talked about the situation with Covid-19 and our outlook for the future.

I'm hoping to spend some quality time with my wife and watch something good on tv. I also plan on spending some time chatting with my mother on the phone to see how she is doing.,"Being of the same age group (my partner was 54 and I'm 50), it seemed that we had very many similar experiences particularly when growing up. It was pleasant to talk to someone near my age and discuss how things have changed since when we were young. We were both pretty open to talking about ourselves.",There was definitely a gap in our combined knowledge in terms of geographic locations. My partner did not seem to familiar with my area so mentioning certain locations seemed to confuse him a bit. I also admit that my own knowledge of his location and general area of the country is significantly lacking.,1.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,7.0,8.0,9.0,9.0,5.0,50.0,50.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,6.0,8.0,8.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,25.0,,,4.0,25.0,,,5.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,male,4.0,white,some_college,1.0,,6.0,6.0,2.0,,False,,,50.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6.25,6.0,,2.3333333333333335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.3333333333333335,4.333333333333333,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.6666666666666665,4.666666666666667,3.6666666666666665,1.6666666666666667,3.0,,

We had very similar experiences growing up and how we are grateful that we grew up the way we did. 
George was a good listener and he liked to share. He wasn't fearful of sharing. I think we respected each other as well. ","Oh, sorry to report but there was nothing that didn't work well. The conversation moved along great and smoothly. The time went by too quickly. I could have chatted with him for at least another 30 minutes.
