I see it going okay, kind of tedious like always because I am still trying to quarantine (even though doesn't seem like a lot of other people are...) so I am not doing anything social. Still, it shouldn't be very stressful and I can pursue some goals of mine.","We had some stuff kind of in common. We obviously are at very different places in our lives, but we are from the same part of the country and I could hold a conversation with her. She put in an adequate amount of effort, as did I. We were able to not have too many lulls in the conversation and keep up a fairly steady flow.","Overall, there wasn't too much we had in common just because she clearly is at a different life stage (stay at home mom with a kid, while I am a student). When she was talking about childcare and school, I could not relate well. In real life, I probably would have no reason to have ever met this person.

We will be having a small get together in our backyard tomorrow with family and I am looking forward to it.  We should have nice weather this weekend too.  Next week we will need to keep our eyes on the hurricane.  It is possible that it will hit New York. ,"It was a very pleasant conversation. I had no expectations and it was actually very pleasant.  We are both different ages but we found lots of general things to discuss.  She is in a large city, just like I am so there were some similarities.  We discussed a lot of mainstream things. ",I think just at the very beginning there may have been a lag.  It's hard to just start talking to someone on a screen.  You don't know what to say or ask.
