Just the usual routine of shopping for groceries online and cooking for my family. I'll read a lot and attempt to restart/maintain some exercise routine. I might watch some TV, but that depends on other people. I don't usually watch anything alone. Mostly I'll try to get myself out of my current depressive episode.","My conversation partner and I seemed to have similar points of view on current issues. This meant that there weren't any disagreements or tension about the coronavirus. They had a lot to say about their job as a substitute teacher and how the school districts are affected by the pandemic, which helped to finish off the conversation. They were friendly and open to the conversation.","I feel like we both had pauses in the conversation where we weren't quite sure what to say next. I felt like they had more to say than I did, and the conversation wasn't very back-and-forth. The closest thing to a common interest was musical theater, but she seemed to have lost her interest in it more than me, so I was hesitant to go off on a tangent about the subject. We talked a lot about the pandemic, but I didn't have much current information about it.",3.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,6.0,4.0,6.0,4.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,6.0,3.0,25.0,75.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,7.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,18.0,,,5.0,,2.0,,1.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,other_or_prefer_not_to_answer,6.0,white,bachelors_degree,7.0,Unemployed,9.5,9.0,2.0,,False,,,29.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.333333333333333,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.3333333333333333,5.0,1.6666666666666667,5.0,4.0,3.6666666666666665,4.666666666666667,4.0,2.0,4.333333333333333,,

I'll be stressed out, but fairly happy when I turn in my schoolwork every night. I think it'll be an uneventful week and I'll be staying inside, and it'll be hard for me to stay motivated. I am cautiously optimistic about this week.","The conversation worked well because my conversation partner was very easygoing, and was fine with letting me ramble on. She was also fun to talk to because she's a good listener and was understanding toward my situation. I believe that I was easygoing as well, if a little too talkative.","The conversation didn't work as well because both of us were conceding to the other when we spoke at the same time. I took the opportunity to be more dominant just to keep the conversation going, even though I don't usually do that.
