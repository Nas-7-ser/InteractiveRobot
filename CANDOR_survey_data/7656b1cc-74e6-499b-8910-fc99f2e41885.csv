I have a lot that I need to get done at work and with two little kids it’s always busy.

She was very easy to talk to and was able to develop the conversation so we both participated which was really nice. We both spoke about commonalities that we could both relate to which made the conversation flow really nicely. ,It was late for both of us and we were both tired.

He was uncertain about whether to discuss an issue in his hometown but chose to disclose an issue he's currently facing with the ultra-orthodox population in his area. He's experienced an issue with COVID transmission and the quality of the schools since the group has increased their political hold on the area. I likened it to what happens in my area with Pentecostal groups and how cult mentality can develop in a niche fashion in established religions. ",4.0,4.0,5.0,"We talked about our professions he is a behavioral analyst and works with autistic populations to assess behaviors and form training plans around findings. He really enjoys the profession even if it can be hard sometimes and appreciates the flexibility that it employs. Neither he or his wife have had issues with employment related to the pandemic. The pandemic has, however, increased his flexibility and time at home, allowing him to spend more time with his four year old and second child who was born at the start of the year, and to complete projects around the house they bought two years ago. He asked what I do and I shared about my position as an accountant among the architects and academics. I briefly explained what that is like and also talked about working previously for Habitat for Humanity as a housing counselor. I talked about how hard it can be and the need to eventually leave the profession. He worked in residential prior to his current position and he found that hard due to the lowered life expectancy of many of his clients. I talked about experiencing the same and about compassion fatigue. He said that he is fortunate to be able to change positions every so often so that he doesn't burn out.",9.0,8.0,3.0,"We talked about parenting and retirement plans. He talked about how he and his wife wanted to sell their house and move upstate when they retire. I talked about my plan to convince one kid to move to Maine and the other to California, to rent an RV and drive between the two of them with the weather. He thought that was funny and a good idea. We shared anecdotes about parenting, as we both have four-year-olds and four-year-olds are hilarious. At the end of our conversation we exchanged names and talked a little bit about how it was interesting to complete different studies, including this one.",4.0,7.0,9.0,8.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,40.0,2.0,30.0,10.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,7.0,1.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,7.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,7.0,7.0,9.0,9.0,7.0,8.0,6.0,9.0,6.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,7.0,6.0,8.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,6.0,"The rest of my week is going to be somewhat frenetic, I think. I still have a lot to do around the house to get ready for the work week and I struggle to balance that with much needed down time. My work week is going to be very hectic as I have a number of very intense meetings and many presentations to give in said meetings.","Charlie and I have similar lifestyles, it seems, despite begin in different geographies. Our shared experience of parenthood gave us an easy topic to discuss and many stories that the other was likely to find amusing. We also feel a similar type of compassion toward people, I felt. Charlie was a nice person and spoke very easily on a number of topics.","I think there was trepidation in the beginning about not wanting to venture into contentious topics, especially around topics of race and ethnicity. I couldn't fully relate to what he was experiencing and didn't quite know what questions to ask. We were also both obviously very tired and a 9pm conversation had us both a little bleary-eyed.",3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,50.0,50.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,,2.0,,3.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,female,4.0,white,bachelors_degree,1.0,,8.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,33.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.75,5.666666666666667,,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,2.0,3.6666666666666665,3.0,3.0,3.6666666666666665,4.0,3.3333333333333335,2.6666666666666665,,
