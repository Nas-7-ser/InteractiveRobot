I also see myself cleaning the house, exercising, and building a chair for my father. ","At first, I thought it was an interview. I went in 'blind' and was ready to answer whatever he asked me. Then, I realized it was just a conversation with a stranger. We talked about the differences between the United States and Canada, which was awesome. For example, the differences in our government and the handling of the Coronavirus. He was very kind and easygoing.","I would have to say that he certainly asked me a lot more questions than I asked him. I wish I would have seemed more interested in his life, because he seemed very interested in mine.

I also see myself conversing with my family, drinking some coffee and reading a good and enjoyable book. Maybe watching a new movie and have a friend come over as well",The thing that worked well was that we conversed about things that interested us as individuals and didnt really care about what we were talking about. We were also having a good time and talking to upwards of 30 minutes so we were just enjoying the conversation overall which made the time fly.,The main thing that probably did not work would be how my conversation partner thought I was interviewing her but I was just another participant in the video conversation.
