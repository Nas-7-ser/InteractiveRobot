I had a hard time coming up with topics but my partner was quick with those questions. We both had similar hobbies which made me more focused on the conversation and that help ask better questions to her about things.  ,The couple of seconds of breaks where we both did not know what to say to each other because we were strangers. It felt like rapid questions and answers and I did not get to expand on what I wanted to say because the conversation topic changed very quickly.
