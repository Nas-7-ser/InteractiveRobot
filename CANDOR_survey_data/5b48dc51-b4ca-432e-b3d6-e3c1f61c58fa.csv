So, I started the conversation on the time and the debate starting at the same time to gage her interest. After seeing that this would be a beneficial topic that would keep her and myself engage in conversation for the allotted time I delve into the topic of politics with her. It helped that she had some of the same viewpoints on the topic at hand.","At first it didnâ€™t seem like we would have a good conversation. But the topic helped us discuss something that we both could relate to. However, as the time counting closer to the 30 minutes I noticed that she kept looking at the side of the computer.
