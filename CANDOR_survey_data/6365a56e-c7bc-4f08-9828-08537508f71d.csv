We also talked about how it is difficult for people to understand Florida if they have never lived there.",9.0,9.0,9.0,"We talked about politics; specifically, about who we are voting for, what we dislike about Trump, the current state of the Republican and Democratic parties, fatigue with politics, dealing with friends and family regarding politics, and we exchanged names.",7.0,7.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,100.0,4.0,100.0,50.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,1.0,9.0,7.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,7.0,9.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,5.0,9.0,9.0,5.0,7.0,9.0,"I think it will go decently. I'll likely think about this conversation several times. I'll have the opportunity to bond with friends multiple times (safely), which is very positive. I do have some difficult tasks, but I do feel very positively about them, and more confident in my abilities with the compliments of my conversation partner.","What worked well was that my conversation partner and I shared several things to bond over. I lived in New York and he in New Jersey, and we both had moved to Florida at some point, so we could relate to one another with this classic trope. He works in IT and I majored in IT. We are both progressives voting for the same candidate. He's a very kind and generous conversationalist, always willing to ask more questions about something I said. I also tried my best to engage with and explore what he was saying.","I do not think anything stood out to me about the conversation as being negative, besides the fact that we tended to go on some tangents. My partner was not rude and did not seem to share any adversarial views, so there was no reason for me to be agitated.

We spoke a good deal about where we are from and how we got there. My chat partner seemed to have more to say at the beginning so I learned that he's lived in several places growing up - Florida, Long Island - but he now resides in Indiana with his wife in a house that they just bought.  ",9.0,8.0,9.0,"We got into a conversation about my chat partners medical issues, namely that he has an inflammatory problem with his body and that he's also bi-polar. He explained the different types of being bi-polar and how he deals personally deals with it medically. His explanations came forward when i told him I have a niece who was recently diagnosed as bi-polar and how she's coming along. He made a very good point that therapy is just as important as the medication.   ",9.0,9.0,9.0,We steered straight into politics and went on for some time about our mutual dislike of President Trump. I was glad to find that we had very similar feelings and was impressed with his knowledge and ability to articulate it. We were all over the place at this point but it was really the highlight of the conversation in my opinion and I enjoyed the discussion.  ,9.0,9.0,9.0,8.0,9.0,7.0,6.0,8.0,90.0,6.0,65.0,85.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,1.0,9.0,7.0,9.0,9.0,8.0,8.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,9.0,9.0,8.0,7.0,8.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,6.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,9.0,9.0,8.0,8.0,9.0,9.0,7.0,"I'm excited for the upcoming week because I'm fully invested in the upcoming election that's finally around the corner. I feel I'm going to continue to be competent at work but I know I'm going to pretty distracted by the news concerning the election. I'm going to be glued to the television and internet getting as much information as I possibly can - within reason of course. There is so much on the line for this country, it's really an incredible time in our history. ",I think what worked best was the broad knowledge my chat partner had that I agreed with. I found him to be very so well spoken and interesting that I found myself listening more than speaking at times. It felt like we had a very comfortable comradery considering our mutual political beliefs that the conversation flowed very nicely.    ,I wouldn't say that the conversation didn't work at any point but I did find myself talking over my chat partner at the beginning of the discussion. We did get into some specific information about his medical problems that I initially felt a little awkward discussing but his candidness and ease explaining it made me much more comfortable. I think once we sort of got use to our speech nuances everything went very well.   ,4.0,4.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,7.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,7.0,45.0,55.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,6.0,5.0,9.0,9.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,25.0,,,5.0,,1.0,3.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,male,4.0,white,bachelors_degree,1.0,,8.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,39.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6.125,5.666666666666667,,1.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.333333333333333,4.333333333333333,4.666666666666667,1.6666666666666667,4.333333333333333,3.0,3.6666666666666665,4.666666666666667,4.333333333333333,4.666666666666667,,
