I was reaching for straws to find something to talk about with him but it seemed as though we were on 2 different playing fields,He didn't really let me get a word in too much.  He was very awkward and talked about topics that I had no interest in.  He also talked about such specialized areas of expertise that it was hard to follow at times.
