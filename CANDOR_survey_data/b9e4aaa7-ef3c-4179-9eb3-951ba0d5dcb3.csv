Then we talked about places she had traveled and some of the coldest weather she had experienced.,7.0,3.0,9.0,The last thing we talked about was the COVID-19 virus and how it's affected people around us. She mentioned having a coworker pass away pretty suddenly from it and we talked about how it's hard to know whether or not you're high risk and what things you should be doing to protect yourself.,6.0,5.0,8.0,3.0,7.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,85.0,4.0,75.0,65.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,1.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,9.0,8.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,I think the rest of my week will go much the same as it's been going for the last few months. I will have my usual work routine at home and then my usual post-work routine of either playing on my Switch or watching TV with my husband. Maybe we'll go look at some stars too. Altogether unexciting.,"I think my conversation partner and I had good chemistry. We had some good similarities with each other which led to easy conversation topics. There was a good flow for the most part, only a few silences while one of us was coming up with something else to move on to.",I think the only real issue I noticed is that since we were strangers it was hard to gauge when the other was done speaking. There were a couple of times when I was wanting to say something and she would keep going with a thought that I had thought was finished and I'm sure it happened on her end as well.,4.0,5.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,8.0,8.0,7.0,40.0,60.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,9.0,9.0,2.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,3.0,4.0,25.0,,,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,female,3.0,white,bachelors_degree,1.0,,7.5,8.0,2.0,,False,,,28.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.25,5.333333333333333,1.0,1.6666666666666667,30.0,11.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,34.0,2.0,4.0,2.6666666666666665,2.0,3.0,3.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,3.0,3.6666666666666665,,
