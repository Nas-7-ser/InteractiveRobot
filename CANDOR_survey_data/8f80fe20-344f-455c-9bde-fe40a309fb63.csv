The weather has been changing a lot so that affects my chronic pain. There are a lot of weather changes forecasted, so my chronic pain will probably be higher on average, which will make things tougher. I hope I'm wrong about this but I'm not sure I will be.",We seemed to have some similar experiences in common which helped the conversation. He seemed like a fairly friendly guy with a lot of different experiences. He was very easy going so it was easy to talk about a wide variety of topics. I think he generally meant well so that made it easy to get a conversation going too.,"He seemed pretty passive, so maybe I was interrupting him more than I should have been. I think it was difficult for me to relate certain things to him because of our age difference.

I have been waiting for this trip for a while now so it is going to feel good to finally get going especially since im taking my girlfriend somewhere shes never been.,One thing that worked about the conversation is neither of us were acting akward so we were able to quickly hop into meaningful conversation. One of the main topics we talked about was sailing which my chat partner seemed to have alot of interest in. I also like to sail so it was easy to make conversation about.,Overall the conversation was pretty good the only thing that i felt didnt work well is that i kept checking the time to see how much longer i needed to talk for and by the end it was kind of weird to say goodbye even though he was just a stranger to me.,6.0,6.0,7.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,30.0,70.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,15.0,,,4.0,22.0,,,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,male,3.0,white,some_college,1.0,,6.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,20.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.375,5.0,,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.6666666666666665,2.3333333333333335,3.0,2.3333333333333335,4.0,3.3333333333333335,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.6666666666666665,,
