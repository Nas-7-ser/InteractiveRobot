So, I see it as upbeat, slightly repetitive, hopefully positive.  I also hope to walk and/or bike with my son and my friend sometime over the remainder of this week. I enjoy positive human encounters and in this most surreal time, I cherish every bit of laughter shared.  I feel gratitude for each human encounter that I have because I am aware of the fact that my own life could end within a month, or someone I deeply love could be taken from me (multiple people I deeply love) with a matter of days.  I feel as if I am living like a milkweed seed in a summer breeze, hoping to find fertile soil (or survival of the pandemic) and hoping to turn into something that may attract a gentle butterfly to flutter near my heart or branch or finger (metaphor-happy, I am attempting to connect my analogies;-D). I just feel like I must live each day appreciatively right now.  I thoroughly enjoyed talking with my person and meeting her lovely animal family. I wish her and her loved ones (and the 94 year old neighbor across the street) continued excellent health and peace. I wish it for my family, myself and my loved ones ~ and you, btw. ;-) Thank you.","The audio was better than I anticipated.   I typically (in Zoom meetings) need to plug in my ear buds.  I was in the process of attempting to get them out and plug them in when our conversation began.  Then, I realized, ""I can hear her just fine!""  So, I skipped it. ","The whole thing this time (Last time my links wouldn't connect me and I still have no clue why ~?) worked extremely well, technically.  I loved the quality of the audio and the video! There were very few lags in conversation.  I do get concerned that I can be too verbose when I am anxious and I offer too many details.  So, I do have a slight fear that I could have talked too much.  But I am aware of my tendency to chatter when I am nervous so I consciously tried to short circuit myself (cut to the chase - though, since she's never heard my stories, she may have no clue that I was actually shortening anything.  I hope it wasn't too much from me.) and to ask her about herself and I truly loved hearing about her animals, the neighbor across the street, the fact that she comes from a Catholic family that sponsored foster children.  I feel like we shared a lot in a short period of time.  She graduated from Cornell and taught k-5 school for a couple of years. She's a really interesting person!  She also has a big heart because her dog, Scooter, was a town stray dog that she saw who she believes ate rocks.  She adopted him and has now become certified with him to be a therapy dog.  They cannot go out during COVID.  But we share a love of animals and dogs.  It was a lovely conversation as far as I am concerned.",4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,1.0,7.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,9.0,3.0,60.0,40.0,7.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,9.0,3.0,2.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,,1.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,,,4.0,6.0,5.0,7.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,7.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,female,4.0,white,bachelors_degree,1.0,,7.0,6.0,2.0,,False,,,58.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.875,6.666666666666667,,1.6666666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,5.0,4.333333333333333,2.6666666666666665,5.0,3.0,4.666666666666667,4.0,2.6666666666666665,4.0,,
