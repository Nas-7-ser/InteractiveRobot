We are in completely different parts of the country, so we have different experiences and perspectives on life. This meant that each of us could talk to the other person about things the other person had not experienced.","There were a couple of spots in which we talked over each other. These were brief, but noticeable because I did not experience that in the other chats I have had in this project.

The rest of the weekend should be pretty chill with only a few real things to accomplish. Monday and Tuesday are going to be busy days at work with lots to do. On Wednesday I'm going to take a small road trip  and then I'm going to the the rest of the week off from work. Which hopefully will be relaxing. ,"I think the conversation I just had was great! My chat partner was very willing to talk and really helped keep the conversation going. She seemed like someone I could chat with for sometime. We didn't have a whole lot in common, but we were able to find enough common threads to make our way. Sometimes having differences can be conversation makers and starters and a good way to get to know someone else.",I don't think anything in particular went poorly. The conversation seemed effortless. I was interested to hear her side of the quarantine story from someone in New York and she provided an interesting example of it. It's hard to tell anything beyond maybe not having enough time to really get to know one another. ,2.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,7.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,8.0,7.0,6.0,40.0,60.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,male,4.0,white,associate_degree,1.0,,8.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,39.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.75,6.0,,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,2.3333333333333335,4.0,4.0,3.6666666666666665,3.0,3.0,3.3333333333333335,,
