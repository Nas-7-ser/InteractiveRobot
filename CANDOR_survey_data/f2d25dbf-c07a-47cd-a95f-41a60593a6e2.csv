I'm headed to an out of town appointment tomorrow, working and running errands Wednesday, and getting new tires on the car Thursday. Normally, my schedule is not so busy. Plus, my husband hasn't been feeling well and hasn't been helping much around the house and I feel like that leaves more on me.","I think we both wanted to be kind and make this work out for both of us. We were polite and stuck to safe topics of conversation. Since he had recently bought a house, that provided a lot of things to talk about. Since we're also trying to buy, I felt like that gave us some common ground.  ","This felt like the kind of conversation you have with someone you don't know that well. Very safe, but not a place where you talk about anything that is particularly important to you or about which you're particularly passionate. It felt kind of boring and empty.
