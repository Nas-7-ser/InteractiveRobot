I've had several good weeks over the past month, and don't anticipate any significant change. I have been more active on many fronts and feel more in control of my life. Furthermore, there has been some positive news regarding COVID-19 vaccines and pending further stimulus payment updates.","We started off talking right away and there was no significant moments of pauses. The person I talked with was very friendly and talkative and provided a lot of information when I asked my questions. Likewise I also provided information of my own which kept our conversation going. We also shared similar interests which propelled the conversations along. I believed there was several topics we talked about, which we could have expanded on given more time.","I think the fact that we were on the clock made the conversation less natural. At the beginning of each conversation with a stranger there is some expected anxiety, and I did feel that at the beginning of this session. We also skimmed over many topics, some of which I would have liked to go into more in-depth.",5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,45.0,55.0,6.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,3.0,4.0,25.0,,,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,male,3.0,asian,masters_degree,1.0,,8.0,6.5,2.0,,False,,,34.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,5.625,5.666666666666667,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,3.6666666666666665,3.0,2.3333333333333335,2.3333333333333335,4.0,4.666666666666667,3.3333333333333335,2.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,,

It looks like work this coming week will be busy, but I won't have to visit all of my offices, so I should be productive.  I am looking forward to evenings on my patio after work, since it will be cooler this week.  I'm just hoping it stays that way for a while!","I liked that Hua (sp?) had a plan going into the conversation. I can tend to be a little shy getting started, but he was very personable, and we actually ended up having a lot in common.  I felt like we had a good flow - neither of us dominated the conversation (there was good give and take), and the time flew by.","I worry that maybe I talked too much about the fact I have a therapist.  Is that weird?  But I am very open about mental health, and feel it shouldn't be stigmatized to have therapy. Also, since he is a professional in that field, it didn't seem out of line.  I can't think of anything else. Since Covid-19 has kept me indoors for the last few months, this was the first social conversation I've had with someone I don't know, and it was honestly delightful.",1.0,5.0,9.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,8.0,7.0,50.0,50.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,9.0,9.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,3.0,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,6.0,5.0,7.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,8.0,7.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,female,4.0,white,some_college,1.0,,6.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,38.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.5,5.666666666666667,1.0,1.6666666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.6666666666666665,4.0,4.0,2.3333333333333335,4.0,4.333333333333333,3.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,2.3333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,,
