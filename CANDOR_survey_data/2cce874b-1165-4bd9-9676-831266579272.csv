Although we only had some things in common, I genuinely enjoyed talking with her. SHe was a good listener and asked some good questions and her overall laid back attitude made her super easy to talk to! She was also very articulate and expressed her thoughts very clearly.","I felt that because we only had some things in common, but not too many that it might be hard to connect with her on topics that we were both interested in. I have kids, she does not. She is a PhD student, and I work some from home but not in academia. She lives in coastal California and I in far northern NY.

We would both actively listen to one another as well as ask open-ended questions to keep the conversation going. We were also polite and respectful towards one another. ",The end was a bit awkward because I think we both finished conversing but did not know how to politely end it.
