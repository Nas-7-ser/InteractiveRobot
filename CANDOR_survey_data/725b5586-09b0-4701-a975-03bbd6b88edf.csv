I also see myself going to different locations and obtainting job applications. At the near end of the week I see myself finally landing an interview and going to it with a calm yet excited expression.,"The flow of the conversation was very driven towards success, failure, and the drive of one's willpower and the use of the one's talents, skills, and experiences to obtain one's benefits. It also highlighted the ability of communication of incite change and convey wisdom and passion in even a few words.",There were a few dead zones within the conversation as well as the apparent age and generational gap between us. Our views differed not simply because of past experiences but also because we were born and raised in different socioeconomic times and thus our core values and beliefs differ widely and that was very apparent.,7.0,7.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,4.0,7.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,47.0,53.0,4.0,6.0,7.0,4.0,4.0,8.0,8.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,16.0,,,4.0,18.0,,,3.0,5.0,3.0,7.0,3.0,2.0,7.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,,male,2.0,black_or_african_american,some_college,2.0,,,,2.0,,True,,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,5.333333333333333,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.6666666666666665,1.6666666666666667,3.0,2.3333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.3333333333333335,3.0,,

I don't have a lot on my calendar and my personal work such as chores and errands is completed. I do on line work and that will probably be slow until about the middle of the month. It will be a lot of reading and Netflix for me.,It was very easy to chat with the person. He was likeable and chatty enough to keep things moving along. He was easy to understand and well spoken and could chat about a variety of topics. It was interesting to hear things from a perspective so different from mine in terms of age and where he was in his career path. ,"Even though we worked at it we didn't really have anything in common from the initial conversation. Different ages, different genders, different locations, different parts in our career. So I think it helped that I just started randomly talking and then we found some things in common - we both do on line work so we were able to share some tips.
