I am starting a medical weightloss program and I am excited to learn about the ins and out of that. Even though 2020 has been terrible so far, I am holding on to a positive outlook.","There was a lot of back and forth in the conversation, it wasn't just one sided. I loved that I learned alot about his occupation. I also was happy to learn that he grew up in California and was familiar with a lot of things here. I liked the ability to get a perspective of the pandemic in Florida.","The only thing I found a slight issue with, but I also felt was completely understandable was when the subject of vaccinations came up. He did not want to discuss it further due to the debate surrounding vaccines, which is fine but I would not have been offended either way.

This is primarily due to it being a holiday weekend and I have the rest of the week off from work. So i will be able to rest and relax as much as one can during these stressful times. ,What worked well in the conversation is that we were both kind and respectful people. Both down to earth. Both agreeable. They were good at asking questions. We were able to find the few things in common that we could have a conversation about. And generally we understood what each other was saying.   ,I feel we did not have interesting things to talk about. There was little variance in topics. We kept returning to the same points of conversation. I feel like I may have dominated to conversation too much. I may not have asked enough questions. I did not find the things we talked about to be too interesting.,5.0,5.0,9.0,4.0,6.0,4.0,7.0,4.0,1.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,7.0,6.0,65.0,35.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,7.0,8.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,20.0,,,4.0,15.0,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,male,3.0,hispanic_or_latino,masters_degree,1.0,,7.0,6.0,2.0,,False,,,30.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.625,5.333333333333333,,1.6666666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,3.6666666666666665,2.6666666666666665,2.3333333333333335,2.0,1.6666666666666667,4.666666666666667,4.333333333333333,2.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,,
