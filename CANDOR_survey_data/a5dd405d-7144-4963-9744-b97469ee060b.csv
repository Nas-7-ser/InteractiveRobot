On Sunday I go to the gym to go to work, so I will be there for two hours. Then the start of my week will be busy but Thursday and Friday are going to be good days. ","I think what worked well is that we had to get into the groove of things, when we started talking about the pandemic that's when our conversation got really good. Even though I don't like talking about the pandemic, it was interesting hearing another person's opinion on how their state is doing. ",I think it was a little awkward at first. I will be honest I didn't really want to come today so I didn't really have any pre-planned topics like I usually do. i felt that I was talking more than what I usually talk when I do these conversation.

We live in very different places so it was interesting to see how cost of living and everything varied up there. It allowed us to ask a lot of questions to keep the conversation fluent and not have too many pauses,We would talk over each other occasionally. I feel like we only wanted to touch the surface for topics and not get too involved.
