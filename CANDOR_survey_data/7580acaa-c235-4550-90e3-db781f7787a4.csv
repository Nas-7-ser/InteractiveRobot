My bf is off the next two days, so I won't be home alone. ","We were both polite and gave each other some time to talk. I feel like we knew how to keep the conversation going about anything and we did just that. We strayed from the initial topic some throughout the conversation. We both are in the workforce, so that made it easier to connect, and we had a few things to discuss other that work. ","We struggled to stay outside of COVID discussions and kept going back to that. I believe I talked too much this morning in an effort to fake my awakeness. I am struggling mood-wise today.
