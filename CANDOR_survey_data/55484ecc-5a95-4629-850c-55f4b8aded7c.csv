I'm going to be spending most of it working. My birthday is on Friday, so I was planning to go out to dinner, but with the likelihood of new COVID-19 restrictions in place by then I likely will pick up takeout. Outside of work I'll be spending some time writing medical school applications and going to the gym.","We had enough in common that we could discuss things for 25 minutes. Jake was a nice enough guy, and we were able to keep the conversation going. We didn't get into anything particularly controversial or personal. We talked about school, work travel, and pets, which are all fairly surface level topics.","We didn't get into anything that would actually allow us to get to know one another. We stayed on the surface, not discussing things like politics or religion. The most personal topic we discussed was COVID-19, which is pretty much all anyone talks about these days. While Jake was a nice enough guy, I don't think I care if I get to know him better.

As it is my last week before my thanksgiving break, I have multiple projects and assignments due as well as meetings. I hope to get a jump on those projects after my class tonight and finish up a bunch of them on Wednesday. I have a good feeling that working this week will be good in terms of making money through tips.","The conversation worked well because we found topics that we were both knowledgeable on and we were both interesting in talking about. Since we are both up-to-date with news and COVID, we discussed that for a bit, as well as our personal backgrounds. We are both passionate about animals and discussed our pets which was refreshing and had positive vibes.","I would say that this conversation was very high quality and I have little to complain about. We did seem to overlap and miss our turns once or twice, which isn't ideal.
