I was surprised to get a man when he popped on, up until this conversation all the other people were women.  We had a good conversation about the region we are from and how we have experienced different survey sites has been similar.","Everything went well, there really wasn't any sort of issue.  We did have some overlap speaking but I think that was mostly because of technological issues.  I really can't say anything went wrong at all.

We talked about the New Jersey and western NY and how the area in which I live differs so much from NYC.,6.0,6.0,7.0,In the middle of the conversation we talked broadly about our experiences using different survey sites. We discussed how Prolific is a much better option compared to other services. I introduced him to MTurk and how it is different from other survey services available.,7.0,7.0,7.0,The end of the conversation dealt more with talking specifically about different surveys we have taken. We talked about how some surveys are interesting in that they have you work together or against other participants.

I need to finish documenting some complicated financial statements for tax purposes. In addition, my work week is jam-packed with responsibilities as well. I am getting pressure from my boss to finish up a large project. All the while I have to conduct important business reviews throughout the week as well.",What worked well about the conversation is my conversation partner had an easy-going disposition. He wasn't afraid to simply be himself and say what was on his mind. This helped me to let my guard down and take on a more relaxed demeanor toward the situation. We felt comfortable sharing experiences on survey sites and finding light-hearted humor in it as well.,"There wasn't really a whole lot that did not work well. The one thing that could have pushed the conversation to a greater depth is if we talked more about our personal lives. Instead, we opted to talk about different experiences. This still gave us an opportunity to bond and share laughs, however the lack of personal disclosure may have limited our ability to get closer.
