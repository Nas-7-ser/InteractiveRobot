Caught up with lectures and keeping track of my assignments. I have more free time to do what I want which is to watch some of my favorite shows and play games. Also I plan to go out with friends this week to play tennis.,Conversation flowed nicely and we stayed on topic around games well. I got some recommendations for games from him which is nice. We had similar range of interest but still had some difference so it was good to learn new information about him and his interest.  Overall the conversation was good. ,"There were a couple of pauses where we both did not know what to say. That is inevitable but the pauses created opportunities to laugh which is not bad. My partner did talk for a long time when it came to his love for nintendo, so I zoned out for a bit.

I have some assignments I need to do as well as some things I want to do personally that will give me some challenge as I make them. It looks like I will be busy doing many things and then I can relax for the rest of it.,What worked well was how responsive we were to each other's questions. We both had similar interests and could give our own views on what we enjoyed on each subject matter. We both spoke our minds and didn't talk over each other much at all to the point where we both got to say what we wanted.,Sometimes we would both freeze up and not know what to say. It led to some uncomfortable moments and we were scrambled for what to say to each other at times.
