We were both amazed that someone else had shown up. She also told me about other chat sites.,7.0,6.0,6.0,We discussed her schooling during the pandemic. We discussed her majoring in computer engineering. We talked about my job and my o search.,7.0,7.0,5.0,We talked about living in California and how the different areas of the state are so different.

A lot of my mental energy will be taken up helping my husband work through his issues with how his mother died. She was a terrible person and he is having to manage her estate. He doesn't handle emotions well and has PTSD from being raised by that monster. Taking care of this puts him right back in a mode where he needs almost constant emotional care. ,"Both of us were really happy to have connected with a live person during the chat. We both seemed like we were personable and potentially interested in each other. We had a great internet signal so overall the chat went smoothly from a technical perspective. We were both intelligent, educated people. ","I got very tired as the conversation went on. My partner was very cagey about answering personal questions. She was evasive to the extent that I lost interest in getting to know her well. I understand her reluctance to answer personal questions, but it limited the depth of our interactions. I had to ask most of the questions, but thenn I only got half answers. She did not ask questions about me.",7.0,7.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,8.0,2.0,7.0,4.0,8.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,75.0,25.0,4.0,8.0,8.0,2.0,1.0,8.0,8.0,4.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,15.0,,,4.0,5.0,,,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,6.0,7.0,8.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,male,6.0,white,professional_degree,2.0,,7.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,52.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,3.3333333333333335,,2.3333333333333335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,1.3333333333333333,4.666666666666667,4.333333333333333,2.0,3.3333333333333335,5.0,2.6666666666666665,3.0,,

I have some labs later this week and a project due. Will continue to do online surveys and probably stay indoors as I have been to avoid people and public. Otherwise I think I would call some friends to chat when we have time.,The conversation went well in that we were able to go back and forth between ideas and bounce thought off each other. The conversation flowed easily and there were few but very little awkward stops. We made sure to keep going and transitioning between topics of ideas once in a while.,"The conversation was a bit awkward at the beginning, there was some stagment silence in cases where we talked over each other or the other person didn't have any input in response to a comment. The issue I realized the most was sometimes when we talked over each other we would try to let the other person speak first.",3.0,5.0,8.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,45.0,55.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,2.0,5.0,,1.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,7.0,8.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,female,3.0,asian,some_college,2.0,,6.0,5.0,2.0,,False,,,20.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.0,5.333333333333333,,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,4.333333333333333,3.3333333333333335,2.0,4.0,2.3333333333333335,5.0,3.3333333333333335,2.0,4.0,,
