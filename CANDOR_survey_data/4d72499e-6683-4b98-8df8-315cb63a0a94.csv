I have a lot of work to get done and exams to study for so I will certainly be busy preparing for that. I also have to do a lot of housework and errands to run. I will need to work on some side projects too!,We both had enough in common that it was relatively easy to keep the conversation going. I also think that it was good to be able to talk about those mutual things like school and working during COVID. We also chatted about anti-mask people and how frustrating that can be,There were definitely some points where the conversation trailed off to nothing and we both had to try to think of a new topic to talk about. We also had some awkward pauses where we either misunderstood each other or talked over one another. Overall the things that didn't work were fairly easily fixed after a few moments,5.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,7.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,55.0,45.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,8.0,8.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,16.0,,,4.0,20.0,,,3.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,female,6.0,white,bachelors_degree,1.0,,8.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,24.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.25,4.666666666666667,,1.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.666666666666667,4.666666666666667,2.6666666666666665,4.0,5.0,2.6666666666666665,4.333333333333333,3.6666666666666665,2.0,3.3333333333333335,,

I don't have much homework assigned for this week. I plan to bake a babka (a type of Jewish cinnamon bread) for my family. I may also take some time to visit a friend. I'm really having a great week.,I feel that I put a lot of effort into the conversation. I tried to be funny and entertaining. I also tried to ask questions of my partner. I think that this helped the conversation. I also communicated to my partner when technical difficulties interfered with me hearing her. This helped by ensuring that I heard everything she said.,I think that the conversation was plagued with lulls. We often had trouble coming up with things to talk about. I felt like she often gave brief answers to my questions and was reluctant to share personal stories. I think that the conversation would have been better if we'd talked more equal amounts.,1.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,5.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,60.0,40.0,3.0,5.0,7.0,4.0,4.0,8.0,9.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4.0,5.0,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,7.0,8.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,female,6.0,white,some_college,1.0,,7.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,21.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.25,5.0,,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.666666666666667,4.666666666666667,3.3333333333333335,2.0,4.666666666666667,3.3333333333333335,4.0,3.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,4.666666666666667,,
