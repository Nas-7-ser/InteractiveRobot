I get to lead worship at church tomorrow, which I am excited about. My daughter and I are also going to do a lot of baking together so I am excited about that. I also plan on finishing painting my house this week. So for the most part I would say that it's going to be a good rest of the week.","What worked well about this  conversation is that I think we both came in ready to make the conversation work. We both were willing and ready to share and ask questions, and we both were willing to listen and respond to each other. This is my fourth conversation and I am always kind of leery about the partner I may get, but so far it has been good because the other person has had the same goal in mind to make the conversation work as best as possible, I believe.","I do not have anything negative to say about this conversation. There weren't any odd pauses, or awkward silence. We both were communicating well and listening well. We both were engaged into what the other person was saying, so there isn't anything negative that took place in the conversation as it was.",5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,3.0,45.0,55.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,9.0,9.0,2.0,4.0,6.0,4.0,6.0,4.0,25.0,,,4.0,25.0,,,2.0,4.0,3.0,6.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,female,3.0,hispanic_or_latino,some_college,7.0,"Homemaker, small business owner ",9.0,7.5,2.0,,False,,,31.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.75,5.333333333333333,,1.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,5.0,2.6666666666666665,2.0,4.333333333333333,2.0,4.0,3.6666666666666665,3.0,4.0,,

I will most likely spend my weekend just relaxing, watching TV and playing video games. I am hoping the rest of the week will be very slow and calm. I have not had much sleep this past week due to work, so I am hoping to catch up on sleep this weekend. ","I really enjoyed how my partner was very friendly. She was very polite and receptive to what I was saying. She asked questions to learn more about the topic we were talking about. Because we both live in different areas, we both asked each other questions about where we lived and what it was like. I felt that that the conversation did not feel like I was talking to a complete stranger. ","What did not work well with the conversation was that we did not ask each other more personal questions to learn more about each other. The majority of the topic that we talked about was about Covid; Although the conversation was interesting, I felt that our topic was not particularly unique. The topic of the conversation was very general and can be had with anyone. We could have talked a little bit more about our personal lives ex: hobbies, worst fears etc. In the end, I felt like I did not learn more about her life.",7.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,50.0,50.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,7.0,7.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,1.0,3.0,5.0,,2.0,,2.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,female,3.0,asian,masters_degree,1.0,,8.0,6.0,2.0,,False,,,24.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.625,4.333333333333333,,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.6666666666666667,4.333333333333333,3.3333333333333335,1.3333333333333333,3.0,3.0,3.3333333333333335,4.0,3.0,3.0,,
