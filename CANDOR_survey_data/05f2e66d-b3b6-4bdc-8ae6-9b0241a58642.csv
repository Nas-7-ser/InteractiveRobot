We talked about how I am a theatre performance major and how I got into that and I mentioned that I like to bake, play piano, and guitar. That I have been playing guitar more than I have played piano but I like both. She mentioned that she is a school teacher and lives in  Southern California.",7.0,6.0,6.0,"We talked about my two sisters and how I get along with them, and she talked a little about her sister, and how they got along well when they were children and that she now lives in Texas which makes her sad since she does not get to see her often anymore. Then we talked about how I am not originally from Arkansas, and that I have been to Southern California before since I have family that lives in Southern and Northern CA. We joked that I visit them only for Disneyland. She asked me if I had been to Disneyworld and if I liked it more than Disneyland. I told her I preferred Disneyworld since there is more to do and she said that she had been thinking about taking her five  year old son there next year. I asked her if she had been to Universal and she said no, and I told her that she should go since it is pretty fun. She said that she is a fan of Harry Potter and wanted to know what the Harry Potter world was like. We talked about how great that part of the theme park is and how she really likes Harry Potter. I told her about a Very Potter Musical. ",7.0,5.0,8.0,"We discussed Fantastic Beasts and Cursed child. We started talking about Sims 4 and discovered we both liked Sims. She has been playing since the first game. We talked about how we don't like the extra content they have been coming out with lately since it has been a cash grab. I had a technical difficulty with my camera so she suggested leaving and coming back in, so I left and came back on a separate device. Then she asked what we had been talking about before, and we started talking about Sims again. She asked what other games I play and I mentioned House Flipper. I mentioned that I have played the second and third sims too. She asked if my sisters play the sims too and I talked about how they'll only play the fourth game. She talked about the mobile games she plays and we talked about how the mobile sims game is no good. I asked her if she had heard of Paralives, and I briefed her on that. She asked me what my favorite and least favorite Harry Potter characters were and she said she tries to be nice to her students so they do not think she is like Umbridge.

I have a lot to do and get done so it might be stressful since I have been putting it off. I think I will be productive, on the whole though, and I think the rest of the week will go well generally speaking. ",We were a lot closer in age so we had a lot of the same interests in fandoms and games like Harry Potter and Sims 4. We also got to talk about that at all which I did not get to do with the older people I talked to in the past. ,"I think we had a problem with pacing, it was hard to tell when to talk or when not to. And at least in the beginning, I wanted to ask her questions but she went so fast I did not get a chance to and if I wanted to ask her something I felt like I had to cut her off or interrupt her.

I think this made the conversation seem more interesting. The conversation was fun because I liked the topics. ,"I feel like I was very awkward. I think I asked too many questions, which made her feel uncomfortable. I also think she might have been more reserved than me.
