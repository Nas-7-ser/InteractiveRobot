I'm going to run a charity DnD game this Sunday, and then Tuesday I am going to have another game with friends. My biggest concerns are getting all the prep done and also spending a little bit of time on my personal screenplays for school later this month.",I think what worked well in this conversation was our shared interests. We both had an appreciation for crime television and I was therefore able to give some suggestions I thought my partner would like. We also both had an appreciation for DnD which gave us another really fun subject to discuss.,"I honestly didn't really think anything worked poorly in the conversation. My conversation partner was extremely polite and friendly and we had a lot of different subjects to talk about. At no point did I feel bored or stressed or like the conversation was dull or going nowhere. Overall, it was very enjoyable!

I usually start every morning with a walk with my partner and our two german shepherds. I then shower and begin my work for the day. I am a psychology graduate student so I have a lot of reading to do for my exams. ,"Both of us were awake, friendly, and motivated to make this a positive experience. We both tried to find commonalities and discuss those similarities and differences. It was great that my partner was feeling talkative and excited to share information with me. I tried to reciprocate as much as possible and be an active listener.","Nothing stood out to me on what did not work well in the conversation. I think it went very well - he was pleasant, kind, approachable, and generally easy to talk to. I enjoyed the amount of effort and positive energy he brought to the conversation, which made this a good experience.
