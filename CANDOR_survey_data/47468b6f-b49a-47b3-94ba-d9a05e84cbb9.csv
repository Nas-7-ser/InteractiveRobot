I am going to try to finish reading a book this week and hopefully also finish a video game I have been meaning to complete for over a week. The only thing really standing in my way is my terrible sleep schedule.,I think that our shared interests worked really well in making the conversation interesting and enjoyable. A mutual love of Dungeon and Dragons guaranteed that we had lots of stories to tell and many different experiences to share. Overall I think our discussions on DnD were definitely the highlight of the conversation.,"I think the only thing that didn't work well was my early anecdote on the weird college class I took. Although my partner seemed to find it amusing, in retrospect it definitely wasn't the type of story to share with a complete stranger.

After this conversation I want to listen to my conversation partner's recommendation as well as write some creative things. Since I have the next week off work I can dedicate time to these without any pressure or stress. Overall, I feel positively about it.","I think the best aspect is that both me and him were good listeners and good at responding with relevant information. By this I mean that we built on each other's stories rather than ignore each other. It was a very ""Yes and"" environment. We were both also respectful and had good faith in each other so I never felt like he wasn't listening or uninterested in what I was saying.","I think in the beginning we were both a bit low energy since we had both just woken up from napping.
