I predict they will go well because people want to be heard and connect. The connection is based on a similar physical and mental attribute. I also feel the next week will not be as dramatic of a feeling of isolation. ,My conversation partner and I seemed to share a similar mindset on time management and value during studies in university. He seemed to have a very level headed mentality toward the current circumstance. Conversation was also more business focused and allowed us both to share advice. Also we gave one another time to speak.,There weren't many lagging in video quality. At first the conversation seemed very stilted and awkward mostly because we were unsure of what to say or talk about. We were able to connect and begin a discussion more about professional studies and work which made the awkward feeling go away.,2.0,2.0,9.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,9.0,9.0,5.0,70.0,30.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,9.0,9.0,3.0,3.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,5.0,,,4.0,15.0,,,6.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,3.0,6.0,4.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,,female,4.0,asian,bachelors_degree,3.0,,8.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,27.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.875,6.666666666666667,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.3333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,4.333333333333333,3.6666666666666665,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.333333333333333,2.0,4.666666666666667,,

I will be going kayaking this weekend and then possibly going to the lake. I will then go back to my apartment and get ready for my internship. I will also see my roommate for the first time in months.,The audio was good and the video was good as well. The conversation went well and we shifted our talking away from coronavirus and started talking about our interests. I asked about life advice and college advice. I got good advice and look forward to implementing it when I go back to school. ,The audio sometimes would lag. The video sometimes was blurry. I also don't know how safe that platform is for security. Maybe next time let the user know how secure that software is. I don't know who I was talking to which was a little bit of a concern I had.,3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,50.0,50.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,8.0,8.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,16.0,,,5.0,,2.0,,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,male,2.0,white,some_college,7.0,Intern,8.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,20.0,20.0,,50.0,20.0,30.0,0.0,0.0,90.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,3.0,3.0,,4.0,,,,6.0,6.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.666666666666667,4.666666666666667,4.666666666666667,1.0,3.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,4.666666666666667,4.666666666666667,1.0,5.0,family,in_person
