We are looking forward to having a nice Halloween at home and hopefully have some fun things planned for the kids that they enjoy. ",I think that the conversation had a very natural flow overall. It did not feel like we suffered through many awkward pauses or felt the need to just fill dead air time with rambling talk. It felt like the topics flowed naturally from one to the next and we shared some perspectives especially about Covid. ,"There wasn't very much during this conversation that I didn't feel worked very well. I mean i do think we were fairly different people as far as what our core interests and hobbies might be (aside from cooking), and i would have loved to been able to talk with her about the Dodgers World Series victory, but she wasn't much of a sports fan.

I anticipate a good final day with my family tomorrow, and to have a good trip to my friend's followed by a really great week with her and her family. The exception to that, I believe, will be election night. I'm very concerned about what will happen that night, and I believe there will be violence somewhere regardless of the outcome. I'm glad that I have a relatively safe place to be during that night, and I'll be watching out for what happens next. 
So personally, I believe I'll have a very good week. Collectively, I think the week is going to be difficult for people in the US, and that will also affect me despite my personally enjoyable situation.","The flow of the conversation was good, especially after we got through the initial questions that my conversation partner asked to get the conversation going. I think the questions he asked were helpful to that end, and they helped build a rapport that allowed us to take more turns talking in the later parts of the conversation especially. We agreed, or appeared to agree, on many things regarding the US response to COVID-19, and the ways that different people have reacted to safety measures put in place to protect us all. That also helped establish a rapport that might have been more difficult to get to if we had disagreed on those safety measures, such as wearing masks. The conversation would have needed to be more careful in that case; having at least some of those opinions in common helped with creating a feeling of being allied, having something in common, and feeling more free to voice opinions, at least on my end.","Initially, I felt my partner was asking me more questions and then listening to the answers rather than engaging in the conversation more fully, but that impression quickly gave way to my feeling that we were each sharing information and points of connection about cooking (beginning of the conversation). It may have been the case that he found my talking about certain recipes or recipe alterations was boring, but I couldn't tell, if that was the case. It's possible that my interest in passing on information may have been off-putting, as I've found that some people in the past have felt bored by it, or sometimes felt as if I'm being condescending, when my intention is to share something I hope is helpful.
