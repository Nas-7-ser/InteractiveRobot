I think backgrounds being alike definitely helped us connect,What didn't work well was the fact that my conversation partner was a lot older than me and therefore all we could really talk about were some of our similarities.

However, I think it will be manageable and I will still be able to get my work done as well as have time for my family.  For the weekend, we will try to get some social distanced outdoor park time.","I think what worked well is despite us being in different times of our lives, we grew up with the same trajectory.  I was able to relate with my partner on their journey from adolescence to adulthood.  This helped spur the conversation on and I was able to speak and listen intently on this topic.  In addition, I think as I had more experience, I was able to give unsolicited advice for my ""past me"" to help them.",I think my partner had a bit of anxiety talking to strangers so it was difficult to get them to speak more openly and have a healthy dialogue between the two of us.  I was having to come up with topics for them to speak on so they would actually talk to me and have something to talk about.
