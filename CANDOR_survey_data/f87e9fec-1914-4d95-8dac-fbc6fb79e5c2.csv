I am hoping to get some rest though which would be nice. ,My partner was tired so I tried to carry it a bit and make it reciprocal. She was very friendly and easy to talk to which was nice. She also seemed very good natured. We definitely had some common interests which is nice and it made the conversation flow more easily. ,We had very different political views. I could tell she was getting upset with my opinion. I knew she would.

","He was generally kind and the conversation flowed pretty well, there weren't any super awkward/painful moments (well, for the most part). Even when we were talking about difficult things we managed to stay pretty nice and understanding towards each other. He seemed like a good-hearted family-oriented person (for the most part). I enjoyed talking about videogames/hobbies with him.","It was basically my fault for introducing politics haha but when he said he would vote for Trump...and I realized a lot of the racist shit he had been subtly-saying was far more overtly racist than I wanted to believe (I like to give people the benefit of the doubt...) and it made me deeply uncomfortable. I generally began to feel like ""maybe this guy isn't as nice as he seems,"" because he kept justifying his vote for Trump with bordering-on-racist tangents and we were so far on opposite sides of the political spectrum I didn't know how to respond...yet he agreed with me that Trump was despicable?
