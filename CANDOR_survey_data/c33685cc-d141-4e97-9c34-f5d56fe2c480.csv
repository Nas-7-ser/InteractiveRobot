I will work from home for the most part. I will be celebrating the 4th of July with my parents, so all my family will drive to Boca Raton for the occasion. I look forward to getting out of the city and enjoying some relaxed times with my family.","I liked the fact that my partner was artsy, she loves music and art. She has a degree in psychology and I liked that she is a deep person and very sweet. She is clearly a person that has things to say and a mind of her own and the conversation reflected that. ",I think the conversation worked well. As two strangers who are very different and are living different moments of ours lives there was some awkwardness in some parts of the conversations. In some instances it was hard to find common ground.

Hopefully that will be enough to keep me afloat financially.","We had an obvious thing to talk about - coronavirus, and it was nice to talk about how it is effecting our lives in different states. It also worked well to talk about work and how we are surviving the lockdown and the different new rules. She was easy to go back and forth with in conversation.","I think we are both extroverted, so sometimes we would slightly talk over each other. At times I found myself thinking of things I wanted to ask based on what she was saying and wanting to interject, but forcing myself not to.
