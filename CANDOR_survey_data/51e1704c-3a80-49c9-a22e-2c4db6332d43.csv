This coronavirus news is getting tedious and frustrating. I like to watch the local news but every day is the same things- xxx new cases, wash your hands, local mom makes decorative masks for first responders etc. I wonder what else is happening in the world, I'm sure there are other events still occuring that we arent hearing about cause all the focus is on covid19",My conversation partner and I had a few things in common that were unexpected so it kept the conversation flowing mostly. We both found this study and prolific through the same medium which was also nice. My partner was polite and friendly and a good listener and also had good questions.,"I was expecting a suggested topic for the conversation so at first it was a little awkward and I didnt know what to talk about. Also it was strange to meet someone with absolutely no context so theres no way to tell what subjects may or may not be appropriate. Having some sort of ""profile"" about the partner beforehand might make the conversations better cause it would give you some idea about the persons likes/interests/views.",4.0,6.0,7.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,7.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,7.0,5.0,65.0,35.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,1.0,1.0,4.0,20.0,,,6.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,6.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,female,6.0,native_hawaiian_or_pacific_islander,some_college,6.0,,10.0,9.0,2.0,,False,,,23.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,2.0,2.0,5.25,5.0,1.6666666666666667,1.6666666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.3333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,1.3333333333333333,4.0,4.333333333333333,2.0,3.6666666666666665,3.0,3.6666666666666665,3.0,,

I have several appointments I am anxious about but I am hoping they go smoothly.  I feel more optimistic about the week than I did prior to the video call.  ","My partner and I had a lot of common interests, and also I was excited to learn about her background and experiences.  She was very interesting.  I also appreciated she was female and around my age.  It would have been a littlke more awkward if we had nothing in common.  ","I can't think of anything that did not work.  She was easy to talk to, and we could have talked even longer because we had so many shared interests and things in common.  We did not have any awkward silences or blocks to the conversation.  I asked about one thing she wasn't familliar with, but then we jst moved on naturally.
