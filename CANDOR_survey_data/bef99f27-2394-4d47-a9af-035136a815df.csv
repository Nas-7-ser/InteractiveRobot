Not terribly, but a bit more taxing than the past few weeks have been, since I have more responsibilities than usual coming up in the next few days, and I am currently going through a period of time where I feel very low energy / drained. ","My conversation partner was extremely kind and agreeable, and it turned out we had a few surprisingly niche interests in common. She immediately relieved some anxieties that I had by introducing herself with her name and pronouns. (I'm transgender and had been stressing about how to present myself prior to the conversation, and her simple action of stating her pronouns and inviting me to state mine made me feel like I was in a safe environment talking to her.) While talking to her, I learned more about some interests I'd already been considering pursuing, and now I feel more motivated to look up more information and try some new things. It seems like she had the same experience in that regard and we're both going to look into some new hobbies/forms of media, so that's pretty cool. ","I was incredibly anxious the entire time, because I was very worried about how I was being perceived, even though I never got the impression that my conversation partner was judgmental at all. Although I'm really verbose, I'm typically the person that responds to conversation topics with new people rather than the person that brings up said topics. Whenever I'm in conversations with strangers where I'm taking on the role of initiator, I feel highly self-conscious. However, there was some reassuring solidarity in the fact that my conversation partner seemed to feel a similar level of social awkwardness, and that we were both making a sincere effort to have an engaging conversation. I found myself worrying I was talking over her sometimes or switching topics too abruptly, though. There's a delicate balance between helping a person out by chiming in with a response when you can tell they're nervous and floundering about how to end a thought/sentence, and actually talking over them so that they aren't able to fully share their thoughts. I was worried I was doing the latter and wasn't giving her the space to speak, but she didn't strike me at all as someone who would tell me (or even hint) if I was making her feel interrupted or cut off (specifically because of how extremely agreeable and friendly she was; I could not have asked for a better conversation partner), so that caused me to feel the burden of having my perceptions of her facial expressions and tone be the only litmus test for how my actions were affecting her. This was stressful because I'm not a mind reader and my perception of others' reactions to me can be easily influenced by my anxiety, and I wanted to make sure my conversation partner was having the most positive experience possible under the circumstances.",4.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,6.0,9.0,1.0,55.0,45.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,9.0,9.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,2.0,,4.0,22.0,,,7.0,7.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,3.0,7.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,male,6.0,white,some_college,7.0,Student,2.0,10.0,2.0,,False,,,20.0,20.0,,10.0,70.0,20.0,0.0,0.0,90.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,,4.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,6.25,6.0,1.6666666666666667,2.3333333333333335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.333333333333333,4.333333333333333,2.0,5.0,4.666666666666667,2.0,4.666666666666667,3.6666666666666665,4.0,4.0,romantic_partner,in_person
