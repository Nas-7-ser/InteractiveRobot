I have a lot of school work that needs to get done, and it often feels like I don't have enough time to do it. I also often feel like a need to unwind but feel guilty for taking a break when I have work to do. Although I am quite excited to catch up with a few of my friends tomorrow ","I think we were able to find things to talk about, though it was quite slow. I found my partner easy to talk to and quite engaging as she often asked me questions and wanted to know more. It also felt like the conversation wasn't one sided, she gave me room to talk and she had time to talk as well. ","I found it hard to be engaged. Maybe it's because I knew that I was most likely never going to see her again, but I often felt like I couldn't think of things to say or ask. I also couldn't really relate to her much and didn't really know what to say. Mostly when I talk to friends, I ask rather personal questions, but I didn't want to cross any boundaries here.

We both are quite agreeable too and were asking questions about interests/ hobbies of the other. There were a few awkward pauses but they were slight and didn't last very long. We didn't have much in common but were open to listening. ,I feel like the age difference between us meant that we're in really different places in life and our location within the US has different cultures.
