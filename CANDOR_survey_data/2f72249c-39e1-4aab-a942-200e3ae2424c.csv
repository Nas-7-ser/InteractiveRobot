I don't really have much to do other than some school work, hanging out with my amazing boyfriend, and going to a friend's bridal shower. I might try cooking some new dishes if I have the time and I run out of food or cleaning so it will be a somewhat productive week.",What worked well was that we both had similar views and ideas about COVID-19 and were able to relate to each other and share stories. She also has a similar personality to me I felt and we both have the background of not being 100% american so I felt like I could relate to her better in that way. ,"Nothing really didn't work well to me, we had no technical issues. If anything I felt like maybe I didn't contribute as much to the conversation as she did. She definitely did alot of the talking and asking follow up questions. I did give my input when I could. Also maybe it didn't work well because we just talked about COVID for most of the time and I personally am a little tired of talking about it.",5.0,3.0,7.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,7.0,3.0,4.0,7.0,6.0,8.0,8.0,9.0,25.0,75.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,9.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,,1.0,1.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,8.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,female,6.0,white,bachelors_degree,7.0,Student,9.0,6.0,2.0,,False,,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.125,6.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.6666666666666665,4.0,2.6666666666666665,2.6666666666666665,4.0,4.333333333333333,3.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,2.0,4.0,,

She was nice and attentive to what I was saying. She's a medical student and she's going to do great once she graduates. Hopefully she'll do great in her life. She seems very sweet and engaged into what people have to tell her.,"I really don't think anything *not* worked.
