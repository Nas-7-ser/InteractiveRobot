We were able to keep a conversation going with minimal pauses throughout the time period. I don't really have much else positive to say about the conversation to be honest because I felt like I wasn't a huge part of it.,What didn't work well was the balance. Overall my conversation partner entirely dominated the conversation. She very frequently went right back to talking about her music and the equipment and set up she has to allow herself to record.
