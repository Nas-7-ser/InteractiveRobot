If my litter of newborn kittens don't get sick, then I'll just be worried sick about money. I haven't been able to sleep since the expanded unemployment expired. If they don't extend that program fast, we're in a lot of trouble. Beyond just the country going off a cliff, we will personally be in a huge amount of trouble. After I pay the rent with the last of my money, we'll run out of food soon enough. Just going to fret through the week.","I think that we're both pretty friendly, agreeable people, so we were able to have a nice freely roaming chat. Also, I'm pretty sure that we have comparable politics, so we were able to commiserate on the madness that's ruling our lives. It also helps that this virus and the subsequent handling/mishandling of it give us all a common frame of reference in which to complain and commiserate. ","I might have led the conversation a little more than necessary, but I don't think that it got on her nerves or anything. It was a nice chat. The only odd thing about it was that there was a timer running. I thought that we were able to jump from topic to topic pretty naturally and there were no noticeable pauses or gaps in conversation.",3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,7.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,8.0,6.0,6.0,8.0,3.0,60.0,40.0,6.0,1.0,3.0,7.0,5.0,7.0,8.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,2.0,4.0,25.0,,,5.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,male,6.0,white,some_college,3.0,,6.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,39.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,2.0,3.0,6.375,6.0,2.6666666666666665,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.666666666666667,4.333333333333333,3.3333333333333335,4.0,5.0,2.3333333333333335,4.666666666666667,4.666666666666667,2.6666666666666665,4.0,,

We had similar thoughts and opinions which I think made the conversation go well. We also listened to each other and gave feedback to each other about our thoughts. Overall, we had respect for each other and were friendly. ","I think at some parts I didn't know what to say really. It seemed like at some parts we'd be talking about the same things over and over. In part, I feel like it's because I'm an awkward person so that may have come into play. For the most part though I thought the conversation was good and had few bad parts.
