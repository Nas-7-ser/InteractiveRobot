I have work to do and I don't see much excitement happening in terms of family or friends. The 4th of July will be weird because people will either celebrate like nothing is wrong or be extra cautious because of COVID-19.,I think the conversation worked well because we could both relate on COVID-19. We both have similar life experiences of going back home and staying socially distant. I think it helped that we are both younger women who have similar political views. She was quite good at keeping the conversation going.,I feel like our conversation worked well overall. If I had to pick something it would be that we kind of limited our conversation to the coronavirus and police brutality topics. I don't know what else I would have talked about if we didn't have those common topics to discuss. The beginning part of our conversation was probably most awkward because it was simple get to know you questions.,6.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,6.0,4.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,8.0,8.0,7.0,35.0,65.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,9.0,9.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,22.0,,,5.0,,1.0,2.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,female,6.0,white,some_college,7.0,student,6.5,8.0,2.0,,False,,,21.0,6.0,,25.0,10.0,25.0,40.0,0.0,75.0,0.0,0.0,25.0,0.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,6.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,6.25,6.0,2.0,1.6666666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,4.333333333333333,3.0,4.0,4.666666666666667,4.333333333333333,4.333333333333333,2.0,4.0,work_colleagues,in_person

I spend most of my time at home and it is raining, so I won't sit outside much. I mostly watch tv or read or help out around the house. I spend a lot of time with my parents, but we don't have much to do. I will most likely do more surveys. ",The conversation worked well because both my partner and I were comfortable talking about random topics. It flowed pretty well and given that we are all going through this pandemic it was easy to find a starting place for the conversation that we both had in common. We shared similar views and opinions on the topics we discussed. ,"There wasn't much that didn't work well. For a short conversation with a stranger the interaction was pretty fluid. There were a couple bouts of silence while we looked for things to talk about, but for the most part it flowed well. Since we did not know anything about each other it was hard to know what you could bring up next as a topic of conversation.
