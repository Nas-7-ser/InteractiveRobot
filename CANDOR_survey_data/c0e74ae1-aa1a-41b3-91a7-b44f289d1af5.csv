I've had a few of these where the pauses in conversation were kind of awkward, but this one didn't feel that way. It was just overall pleasant. We found a few common ground things to talk about and mostly just kept it going based on that.","I know I was kind of distracted through it. Like I said before, chronic illness stuff has me feeling pretty not good, right now, so my focus is scattered and my energies low, and I think that did negatively impact how engaged I was.
