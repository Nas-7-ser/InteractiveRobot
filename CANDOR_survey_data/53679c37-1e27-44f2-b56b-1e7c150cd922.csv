",I felt like I asked a lot of questions which really helped. My partner also didn't answer the questions with just yes or no answers and rather expounded on his answers which helped me think of questions to ask next. He wasn't closed off and neither was I which helped move the conversation along. ,"My partner never asked questions back to me. He didn't seem that interested in my life or hearing my answers. While my partner seemed nice enough, he definitely didn't offer a lot when it came to adding to the conversation. If I didn't keep asking questions, we would have sat in silence for some time.
