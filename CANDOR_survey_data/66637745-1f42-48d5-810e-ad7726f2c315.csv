I am hoping for a productive week hopefully despite the lockdown still and virus. ,I think what worked well was that we had the same thoughts on things and we stood the same way in terms of trump and the virus. That made the conversation flow a lot better and we were both kind and willing to listen to each other when we spoke which was a plus,I would not say anything was bad but if anything maybe the fact that we did talk about some negative topics such as going back to work and her husband wanting to be back at the office since that was something I was hoping to avoid/did not want for my future,5.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,6.0,40.0,60.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,8.0,9.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,5.0,,1.0,2.0,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,6.0,5.0,7.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,7.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,female,2.0,asian,masters_degree,1.0,,6.0,5.0,2.0,,False,,,24.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.5,6.333333333333333,,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,3.3333333333333335,4.0,3.3333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,4.666666666666667,4.0,3.0,4.333333333333333,,

We're sad that we can't take a trip but we're going to have dinner on Thursday at one of our favorite restaurant chains, on its patio. I'm a little nervous about going out because of COVID-19 but I hope everything will be okay. Other than that, we're going to watch our wedding video and some movies and order good delivery food for the rest of the week. It will be nice, a little odd but nice.","We were able to connect with each other about COVID-19, which is a subject we can all relate to and speak about. We were able to chat about precautions to take and working from home versus going to the office. She lives in Boston so I was able to tell her I have family living in Brookline.",I felt like I spoke a lot more just to fill the time because the conversation kept dying out.
