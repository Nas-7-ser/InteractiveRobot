She told me that she was an estimator and I explained that I taught high school. We talked about math because both jobs are math related. We also talked a little about where each other lived as we moved toward the middle.,8.0,7.0,7.0,"I explained about where I live. It is the middle of nowhere, very low population, and I love it. She explained that she lived in Massachusetts but not Boston, which is the only city I've ever been to in Massachusetts. Her town is the population size of our whole county, which would be quite large to me, but I imagine where I live would be very low density in her mind.",8.0,8.0,8.0,"Mostly about our kids. She has two that are on the autism spectrum. I told her stories of my kids, who are wild, and specifically about my middle one, who has a weird super memory and often is ridiculous.

I'm a little upset about the weather forecast but there isn't much I can do about that. I am excited to watch my kids play baseball and if it keeps raining we won't get any baseball games. I do think work is going to be stressful too but all I can do is to do it.,"I think what worked well was the amount of humor. I tried to keep it light and fun, and I think she enjoyed that. She laughed at my jokes, or at least we both were laughing a lot. That's always a good thing in my mind. I felt like overall it went well.","There were not a lot of problems. Sometimes I worry because I don't feel like I'm very good at starting a conversation, but luckily neither of us knew what to start with so it wasn't too awkward. I also sometimes over-talk and over-share, but I tried to keep that in check a little bit this time.",6.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,3.0,7.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,7.0,4.0,65.0,35.0,6.0,3.0,1.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,3.0,5.0,,1.0,2.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,8.0,7.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,male,3.0,white,masters_degree,1.0,,7.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,34.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.5,6.0,,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.3333333333333335,4.666666666666667,3.0,2.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,3.0,4.0,3.3333333333333335,2.0,4.333333333333333,,

I do plan on taking them out on Wednesday which will be a break from our routine and have to ""catch up"" on Thursday and Friday.  I also am planning on running a lot of errands on Tuesday, my day off from work.  I am planning on that day being pretty relaxing since I won't have care of my children or work, so I will be able to take some time to myself.","What worked well was being able to find something in common - we both have children, and we are both experiencing the pandemic (although differently).  We were able to share similar parenting stories.  My partner spent time filling in the gaps when the conversation started slowing down by switching to other stories.","The only thing I found that didn't work well was that my partner spent more time telling about himself, and I would have expected him to ask more questions about me, especially since we didn't know each other.  I asked a few questions about him but didn't find that reciprocated.
