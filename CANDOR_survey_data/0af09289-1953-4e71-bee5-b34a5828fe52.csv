My partner and I will probably go walk around a store and grab dinner and then plan out the rest of our weekend. ","I don't think there was a prompt, so we both just talked as if we were normal strangers put into this situation and not as if we had to talk about certain things. I think we both had a willingness for this conversation to go pretty well and work out. ","I wish the video would have had a count down within it and it would have just stopped. It felt weird to cut her off and kill the conversation, but I only planned on talking for 25 because I need to get back to work. It felt rude and ridiculous.
