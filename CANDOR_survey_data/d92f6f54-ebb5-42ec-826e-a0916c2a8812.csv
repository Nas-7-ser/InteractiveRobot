Basically I have 67 12 page midterms to grade and I am barely being paid ANYTHING to do it, so I will be grading for hours on end and probably complaining about it and getting super frustrated. YAYYY grad school is the best! ",I think what worked well is that we found common topics to discuss. We are both students adjusting to virtual learning and we both tutor so it was easy to find common topics to explore. She is also an active listener so it was easy to talk because she was clearly engaged,For the most part it was pretty smooth because we had enough to talk about to fill the time that we were talking for. I think towards the end it was dying down a bit because we were kind of running out of things to say but eventually she said she had to go so that was the end of it ,3.0,4.0,5.0,8.0,9.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,8.0,8.0,5.0,50.0,50.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,8.0,8.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,3.0,4.0,25.0,,,2.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,7.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,female,4.0,black_or_african_american,masters_degree,1.0,,7.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,25.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.25,6.0,,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,3.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,2.6666666666666665,3.0,2.6666666666666665,2.6666666666666665,4.0,3.3333333333333335,4.0,,

I hope we get better rather than exploding. ","We both had similar backgrounds and worries/complaints about life so that really worked. I think our core beliefs were in sync and that made conversation really good, combined with a similar age demographic and similar professional wishes. Our sense of humor was the best too, we laughed at the same things. ","I can't really think of anything hugely distractive or bad. Sometimes she talked a lot more than I did, and I was worried about getting a word in the discussion, but overall it was not really that bad in retrospect. I often feel that I can get out what i need to say in shorter form anyway.
