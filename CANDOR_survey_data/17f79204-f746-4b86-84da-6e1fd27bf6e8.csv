William told me that he had just moved to Pittsburgh so he was still figuring out whats he's doing there as its only been a few days. I talked about what I research at school. ,5.0,5.0,6.0,We talked about COVID and about politics. We talked about hoping that things would change soon (i.e. Biden would be elected) and who our initial preferences had been for the election. William wanted Warren. He didn't mind Bernie but prefers someone younger. I said that I liked Bernie and Warren as well and asked about a third candidate he said he liked who I hadn't heard of. We also talked about the governor of Mississippi. ,6.0,6.0,7.0,"We talked about billionaires and about a wealth tax. We talked about people making decisions that harm them. At some point we talked about football, baseball, and basketball but I'm not sure where in the conversation that was.

I am currently waiting on some medical test results that will largely determine how the rest of my week goes, depending on when I get them. The second half of my week is a bit less busy than the first half was, though, so that is good at least. ","The video chat worked well. We were able to maintain a conversation for the full 25 minutes. We were pretty good about not cutting each other off, and discussed a variety of topics. We had similar view points on politics so it was easy to discuss which it may not have been otherwise. this also made me feel like we had similar morals. ",Our conversation was somewhat surface level. We talked about several different topics but did not get too deep in to them. William seemed a bit hesitant to bring up politics at first as he perhaps did not want to offend me if I supported the opposite party. At times I felt a little bit awkward. Talking on video chat makes it hard to actually make eye contact especially because of where my camera is. ,3.0,2.0,7.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,8.0,9.0,8.0,47.0,53.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,7.0,8.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,10.0,,,4.0,11.0,,,4.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,female,4.0,white,masters_degree,1.0,,8.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,27.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,3.0,3.0,5.375,5.666666666666667,2.6666666666666665,2.0,29.0,7.0,10.0,4.0,4.0,47.0,4.0,3.3333333333333335,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,2.6666666666666665,4.0,,

We both seemed pretty polite and adept at conversation. Carissa (SP?) was very friendly and easy to talk to. Carissa seemed very intelligent and kind. We both also don't like cold weather.,I wouldn't say it was a perfect conversation but we got along very well. I think it's possible that she might have had a stronger academic background than I did but it wasn't an issue and she didn't act superior to me.
