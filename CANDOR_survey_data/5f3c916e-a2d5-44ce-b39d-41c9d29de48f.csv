Also, a water pipe broke under our house and but, luckily our landowner owns a plumbing company so that won't set me back financially.","Everything worked well. 

The gentleman I spoke with was/is incredibly pleasant and, we chatted about anything and, everything with ease and, I believe mutual curiosity and, enjoyment.  We had a lot in common but, without knowing a ton of specifics about each other we established early on that we were personable and, could have a conversation with just about anybody about whatever and be at ease.","There was nothing that didn't work well.  The gentleman, as I said, was a joy to speak with and, his warm personality shone brightly as we chatted.
