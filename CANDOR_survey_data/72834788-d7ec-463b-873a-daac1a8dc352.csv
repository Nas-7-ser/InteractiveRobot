She also started to talk about politics with me. ,7.0,7.0,9.0,We wee talking about different career paths and how the pandemic has really isolated a lot of people and made it more difficult to connect with others whether it be online or in person. ,8.0,8.0,9.0,We talked about different career choices and opportunities that are available right now during the pandemic and how some of the different career paths can be really boring such as those pertaining to networking or security. ,7.0,7.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,95.0,6.0,100.0,100.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,1.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,8.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,I see it going very well with me continuing to work and make sure that I stay busy everyday doing things around the house and office that need to be done. I also am going to try to make some new friends and try socializing a bit more as the pandemic has made me feel a bit isolated. ,"What worked well was the fact that we are both within the same age bracket, are both about as intelligent as each other which made the conversations go smoothly, and she was very warm and liked to smile quite a bit which made it very easy for me to feel comfortable opening up to her and talking about any topic that I think we might be interested in. ",I think the fact that she was really into research and I'm not really into research as much as her made it a little bit more difficult for me to relate to her in terms of being excited about research. I think that the fact that she thought that future generations will be able to be able to get all of the social interaction that they need through online communication was another thing that made it a little difficult for me to relate to her. ,9.0,9.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,9.0,9.0,5.0,50.0,50.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,9.0,9.0,2.0,2.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,,1.0,1.0,4.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,1.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,male,2.0,white,completed_high_school,1.0,,9.0,9.0,2.0,,False,,,32.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,5.875,7.0,2.0,2.0,28.0,14.0,9.0,2.0,0.0,16.0,1.3333333333333333,5.0,5.0,1.0,2.3333333333333335,4.333333333333333,5.0,5.0,1.0,4.666666666666667,,

There was rarely lulls nor did we talk over each other, our discussion easily advanced from one topic to the next and there was generally a high level of engagement on both our parts. We also were both mindful of each other and able to readily read and utilize information about each other's experience and views.","I am hard pressed to find much that didn't work well, I really feel there was fairly little or even nothing that I would say ""did not work well.""
