I will be doing work on the ranch and repairing things on the property so I think my life will continue on as normal. I think I will start hearing from my relatives more because of the holidays which is always nice.,It worked well when we asked each other about different things in our lives and the area that we live in. The conversation went well when we started talking about the homes we lived in and how we are trying to fix them up which was a common ground for both of us.,When we started talking about our family lives as there is such a big age difference that we didn't have to much in common there to talk about.

There is nothing big happening in my household for the next week so I expect it will be the usual mix of family time, chores, working from home, finding time to relax, errands, etc. The last few weeks have been exhausting so I look forward to a boring week ahead.","Teresa (sp?) was a very good conversationalist. She was open to sharing details about her life and her background -- which was very interesting to me -- and also was good at asking me questions about my life and background. Asking questions to your conversation partner is a crucial aspect of a good conversation, and we both did that pretty well. We were each also willing to share details about our lives that we thought the other person would find interesting and/or that built on what the other had said. That also worked out pretty well.","We broached the topic of politics briefly very early on, and I wasn't sure where that was going to go. It came up incidentally when I mentioned I live in Philadelphia, so I didn't feel like either of us were actively pursuing politics, and we both successfully avoided getting deeper into it by saying we are both looking forward to January 20, and moving on from there. I am usually very willing to discuss politics, but in this context -- talking to a stranger for a mandatory 25+ minutes -- I didn't want to risk sullying a good rapport, especially so early in the conversation, if it turned out that we had fundamental disagreements.
