Overall, I think it will be positive otherwise and I will be successful in making those deadlines.","What worked best is we found something we had in common almost immediately - we both have dogs. This only happened because his dog appeared on screen and I asked for her name and how old she was. We talked about how many pets each of us had and that opened the door to funny stories about the dogs, how the dogs eat, and what they do. The rest of the conversation flowed well after that.","I think we would have had a rougher start to the conversation if his dog hadn't come up on the screen.
