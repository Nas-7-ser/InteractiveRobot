In the evening I am going to have dinner with my wife and then we are going to relax and perhaps watch some TV before going to bed. This routine is going to be repeated for the rest of the week.","The conversation started really well, I found my chat partner very likeable and we quickly found some interesting topics to talk about. There were virtually no gaps in during the conversation and each one of us had something to contribute to the conversation. Overall it was a very pleasant experience.","I can honestly not think of anything that didn't work so well. We had a pleasant conversation and even went overtime.

My conversation partner was friendly and willing to talk about his experiences so I think that was also helpful. Mutual respect was also advantageous to our successful and enjoyable conversation.",We both identified as introverts and I think at times we did have some lags in the conversation because we were not sure where to go next.
