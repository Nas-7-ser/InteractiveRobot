While they (both chiropractors in the practice) are rated very high, it is a low number of people making the ratings. I looked at several sites to see if their customers favored other sites. While I generally do not trust a very low number of ratings, they have been in business for a very long time. The business grew enough to require a second therapist so I am going to take that all as positive. I have not had an adjustment in 3 weeks, while I normally go every week. So I am looking forward to some pain relief. The day after I get to see my masseuse for the first time since April so I am really looking forward to that.","We were/are close to the same age, same demographic area. We have similar political points of view, but this is an assumption, we did not talk politics, but we did discuss a little how seriously people are currently taking the Pandemic. Sean lives in Virginia about 100 miles south of Washington DC. It is area of the country that is very picturesque. We discussed various places. Like he has family in Michigan, west of where I am. He is originally from Pennsylvania near Pittsburg.","Sorry but we got along well and I have nothing to say to this question. I know that Sean is going to have prostate surgery. I had a timer set, so we know when the time was up. We talked a little more anyways. So I will address the only thing that fits, even if you specifically excluded it: The first several minutes the video I was getting was very blurry. I initially thought that he must not have a high definition camera. However it did clear up and remained clear the rest of the conversation. So I believe the issue was initial poor connection strength, that I was getting a low data signal thus a low data picture. So the internet found a better connection for us and after it fixed the picture it all worked well.",3.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,8.0,4.0,55.0,45.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,6.0,3.0,2.0,6.0,5.0,7.0,5.0,,1.0,4.0,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,7.0,4.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,male,6.0,white,bachelors_degree,7.0,"I am disabled but was working part time to supplement social security, I took a leave of absence when I learned that hypertension is a condition that makes me more susceptible to Covid19, my last work day was April 7, they laid me off June 10 because they were paying my dental insurance and now it starts on COBRA July 1",9.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,60.0,5.0,,85.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15.0,0.0,15.0,55.0,30.0,0.0,1.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,,4.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,6.0,2.3333333333333335,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.6666666666666665,4.333333333333333,4.333333333333333,1.3333333333333333,5.0,2.0,4.0,4.333333333333333,2.0,3.6666666666666665,family,phone_call
