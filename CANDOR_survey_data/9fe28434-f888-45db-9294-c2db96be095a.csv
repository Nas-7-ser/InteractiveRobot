I'll take a break in the middle of the day to go outside and take a long walk.  Evenings will be for leisure activities.,I'd characterize it as high energy.  My partner was enthusiastic and spirited.  He seemed genuinely interested in knowing about me particularly since I grew up and lived most of my life in the city he's living in now.  For almost all of the conversation there were no lulls or awkward silences,I think my partner had to use his phone because of some technical issues so the visual was a little off but not detrimental to the conversation.  Just had to get used to it.
