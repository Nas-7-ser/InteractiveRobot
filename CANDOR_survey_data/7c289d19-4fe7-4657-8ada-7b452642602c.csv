I'm excited to get back to working full time in the lab next week, and I have plans that I'm looking forward to with my significant other. I think it will be challenging in that I'm starting new projects, but fulfilling as I'll be able to see people that I haven't seen for a while.","I was super happy with the person I was matched up with. She was kind, exuberant, and humble. Even though we had some technical issues in the beginning (only one of us could speak/hear the other at a time) we were able to work through it and still have a great conversation. It worked well that we weren't exactly the same (different age) but that we also had a lot in common (homeschool, being from a big family, faith, etc.).","One issue was that we couldn't hear each other without pressing a button to switch from one person to the other. This made it kind of awkward and we ended up having her always press it, so there were times when I wasn't sure when she could hear me, and other times where I wanted to say something but couldn't because the active mic was still on her side.",4.0,4.0,7.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,8.0,8.0,9.0,9.0,7.0,40.0,60.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,9.0,9.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,25.0,,,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,6.0,5.0,7.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,8.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,female,3.0,white,completed_high_school,7.0,student,9.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,20.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.375,6.666666666666667,,1.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.6666666666666665,5.0,4.333333333333333,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.6666666666666665,4.333333333333333,2.3333333333333335,4.666666666666667,,

I will celebrate my thirtieth anniversary with my husband. We will take a little trip; we will celebrate our dear friend's birthday and his surviving cancer one more year. I will do my usual cooking and taking care of my family. Hopefully we will go to a winery for a picnic as well.,I think right off the bat we found that we had homeschooling in common. I am a retired homeschool Mom and she a homeschool graduate. We also come from large families. I am the oldest of five and she the oldest of six. We found that we both enjoy literature and have a common faith background.,The only thing that didn't work well was the sound. Only one of us could speak at a time because with the microphone button only one could hear the other. But we just took turns talking and asking each other questions. It was really a very enjoyable conversation and I would welcome the opportunity to talk with her again.,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,2.0,60.0,40.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,7.0,7.0,9.0,9.0,2.0,2.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,,1.0,3.0,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,5.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,female,1.0,white,some_college,6.0,,7.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,51.0,3.0,,25.0,50.0,25.0,0.0,0.0,100.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.875,7.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.333333333333333,5.0,5.0,2.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,4.333333333333333,4.666666666666667,4.666666666666667,2.3333333333333335,4.666666666666667,romantic_partner,in_person
