We have common interests in music. Also, we're both involved in grant-funded work. This gave us many avenues of conversation to explore. In fact so many, that I could have continued to talk with her for another 30 minutes easily.","I'm not much of a story teller, so often my answers to people's questions are a bit short and don't have a satisfying conclusion.
