Then we discussed what the weather was like now and what the weather is like during the different seasons.,9.0,9.0,7.0,We discussed how crazy it is living in California. Mainly because the people running this state are all nuts. Then we discussed what's open in Texas compared to what is open in California.,8.0,8.0,8.0,We discussed how many times each of us has done one of these types of surveys.

I have a lot to do and not much time to get it all done. Although I plan on enjoying what time I have left here, so I also plan to enjoy myself too.","Well I would have to say that the one thing that worked the best, was that she was very friendly. It makes it so much more enjoyable of a time when the person likes to converse back. She also was someone who talked back. She asked a question I answered, I'd ask a question and she'd answer. So that worked great!","To be completely honest the only thing that didn't work well in our conversation was a glitch. There was a moment where when while I was talking, the screen froze one her. A few seconds later it came back up and we were able to continue the conversation.

Lots of TX pride",7.0,7.0,7.0,"We talked about COVID-19, what has opened back up and what hasn't in each our states... talking about movies and how it is easier to watch a movie at home and much cheaper.

We both asked questions and talked about our experiences in Cali and Texas, and she is looking to potentially move to TX.  I encouraged it, and I shared info such as how cost of living is lower, and there is less wasteful spending.  I felt like we shared a lot","Her daughter came into the camera and that got distracting as her feet sometimes were in the view of the camera.  She was 3, so I get that kids can be tough to control.  I think it was interesting she said she doesn't like to talk politics but then spoke about politics and Newsom - governor.  Although she strikes me as more conservative than the average Californian, so I think we would have agreed had politics come up more.  I decided not to go there...
