And we had travel as a common interest. I also think we built off of what the other person said in our conversation. ,"I think that sometimes we talked over each other, which is probably the result of us thinking of what we wanted to say and then both talking at the same time, or thinking of something that we were reminded of by what the other was saying, and wanting to share that right away.
