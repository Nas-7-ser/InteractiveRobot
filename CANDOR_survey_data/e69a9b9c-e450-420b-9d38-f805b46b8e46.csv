I can only do so much about the situation though, so I just try to do what I can and then go on to the next day.",She was very warm in both her smile and tone of voice. She was able to keep the conversation going by asking questions and did not take over the conversation but was good with a back and forth. She had things in common with me which made it very easy to feel open with her and she did not get too personal to quick but seemed to feel things out a little before going in to things which is awesome.,"I was nervous as I tend to be a slightly more anxious and nervous type person.

I will be working tomorrow but looking forward to having some fun over the weekend, I have a project I'm working on and will have some help with it, and I'm hoping that means there will be a lot of progress done on it. ","Sara was easy to talk to. She was friendly and easy to talk to. We quickly found some things we had in common and she was a good listener. I tend to ramble when I'm nervous and am not good at making transitions when there are pauses in conversation, but she didn't make me feel awkward at all. ","The video was great, the hardest part was there was a little bit of difficulty if we both spoke at the same time, which is typical of video chatting. I'm just not very used to it because most of my work is still being conducted in person and I'm not using videoconferencing enough to be really comfortable with that yet. It's not quite the same as using something like Facetime.
