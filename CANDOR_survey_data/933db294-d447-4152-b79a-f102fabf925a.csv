We also talked about how covid had impacted our situations from a family perspective and also from the perspective of how it impacted our kids and their schooling. ,8.0,8.0,7.0,During this part we talked a lot about sports. We talked about how he was an Auburn fan and how it can be frustrating to be an Auburn fan because Alabama is such a dominant force. I talked about my relationship to Cal sports and how that is a constant gut punch. We also talked about the Dodgers a bit. ,8.0,8.0,8.0,At the end we talked a little bit more about baseball playoffs as well as a little bit more about his job.

We are supposed to go for a little outdoor trip this weekend and that would be fun. ,I think that the conversation had a really nice balance and flow. He was an easy to talk with guy and the fact that we were both fans of college sports helped the conversation feel comfortable and easy. We were able to bounce around on topics and keep up with each other ,"I dont really think there was much that didnt work well during the conversation. There might have been some regional differences given his experiences of growing up in the south and living in the mid west, but even with those differences it felt like we could find a lot of common ground.

After my work week is complete, I will travel 3 hours back home. The weekend will include having family come and stay with me. ",The main item that worked well was our willingness to have an open and friendly discussion. We both were open to finding out about each other with real interest. The genuine interest helped to make the conversation seem effortless and feel like two individuals sharing some commonalities with each other.,"Having a video discussion made it difficult at times to tell when the other person was done talking. It allowed times for us to speak over each other.
