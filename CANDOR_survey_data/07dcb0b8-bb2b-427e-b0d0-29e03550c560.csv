I plan on continuing to work throughout the recovery of COVID-19. I plan on going to restaurants while maintaining social distancing with my friends. I am going to exercise more often by jogging around the neighboorhood. Overall, my week will be productive.","I think what worked well with the conversation is that we had similar views around COVID-19. We spoke about the efficacy of vaccines, the mandates of wearing a mask out in public, and the goal to protect others from spreading the virus. I think it was great to hear someone echo your own sentiments like my partner did.",I think what didn't work well is that there were moments where I felt the conversation was forced. Nerves may have contributed to the conversation. There were times where I felt like I had to ask questions to keep the conversation going and my partner did a lot of the talking and I did most of the listening.,5.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,8.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,40.0,60.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,8.0,8.0,6.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,22.0,,,4.0,24.0,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,male,3.0,asian,masters_degree,1.0,,6.0,6.0,2.0,,False,,,31.0,3.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,100.0,0.0,0.0,70.0,30.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.75,5.333333333333333,1.3333333333333333,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,4.666666666666667,1.6666666666666667,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,work_colleagues,video_chat

A whole lot of nothing but staying home, watching tv, playing with my girls and taking some surveys. With any luck I will get a riding lesson and be able to take my girls to the pool.",We were both ready and willing to have a conversation. We wanted to get each other's opinions on the Cvid-19 and while we might have liked to talk about other things that really is the most pressing thing. I think we were both interested to learn what it's like in our respective states and how different it is. ,"I think the only challenge with the conversation really was that he had more schooling and was more advanced in his thinking so I felt a little self-conscious. He asked me how it worked and since I had done this before at least I knew what to do, but after that he really took over the conversation.
