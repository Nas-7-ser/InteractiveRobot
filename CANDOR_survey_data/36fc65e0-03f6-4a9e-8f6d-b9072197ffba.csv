I've no particular events happening, so it will be more of the same: sleep, eat, work. I might watch some new stuff on netflix I guess or order some different food. I've also been meaning to get test for covid-19, but it's been hard to find times when it isn't very crowded.","I was able to find some common ground with them in the beginning regarding traveling, live in different cities, and experience driving. This gave me the opportunity to ask about areas where we most likely would have less in common, such as what we do. I lucked out and the person had a very interesting field of work, whereas mine was pretty boring so I dreaded coming up to that. So I asked a lot about what they do and that led to some interesting conversation.",There were some awkward pauses as I tried to transition to different topics. I didn't want to just talk about pandemic life so I tried to see what details I could draw upon to steer things in different directions. I felt the driving part of the conversation had more lulls. It was also harder to end the conversation since I could keep asking about what they did but I also wanted to be fair about using up their time and couldn't quite tell due to video quality (can't see facial expressions so clearly) what their interest level was.,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,50.0,50.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,25.0,,,4.0,25.0,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,male,4.0,mixed,masters_degree,2.0,,8.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,37.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.875,5.666666666666667,,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,4.0,1.3333333333333333,4.333333333333333,2.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,4.0,1.6666666666666667,3.6666666666666665,,

There is still a lot of work to do though so it will be a bit stressful.  But on the bright side I will skype beer with a friend of mine this evening","The pandemic and our area's responses to it were a good conversation starter since everyone is experiencing similar stuff right now.  That then broke the ice enough to talk about other, less generic things, like road trips and how we approach them.  That then made us comfortable enough to talk about something more personal, like work.","I don't think there was anything major that didn't work.  We both kind of talked over each other or interrupted each other a few times, but I think that is to be expected between video calls especially with people who don't know each other well.
