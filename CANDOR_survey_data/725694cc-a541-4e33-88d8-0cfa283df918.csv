There will probably just a lot of time where I get to do nothing or just spend time on the web. I will probably continue listening to music without end and do surveys whenever they come up. Maybe I will get some groceries later on this week or just wait til next week to do so.,The thing that worked well is that both of us were around the same age I presume. She was an adult just like me so we communicated very well. What worked well also is that she mostly spoke and I just listened which is fine by me. I would rather just let the conversation continue than just having to think of things to say.,One thing that I noticed about my partner is that she tends to be dominant in the conversation. I tried to interject and change the direction of the conversation but she would continue on and on. I didn't really have a problem until she let me speak but by that time I think we had already hit the 30 minute mark.,5.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,8.0,3.0,9.0,7.0,3.0,6.0,7.0,9.0,7.0,8.0,30.0,70.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,8.0,9.0,2.0,6.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,1.0,2.0,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,6.0,5.0,7.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,male,3.0,hispanic_or_latino,some_college,2.0,,7.0,9.0,2.0,,False,,,39.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.25,5.666666666666667,,2.3333333333333335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,2.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,4.333333333333333,3.6666666666666665,2.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,4.333333333333333,3.3333333333333335,,
