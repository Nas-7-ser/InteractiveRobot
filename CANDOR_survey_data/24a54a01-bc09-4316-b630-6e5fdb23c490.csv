I work 12 hour shifts for the next 3 days.  I will probably be exhausted those days, I tell myself I will work out after work but will likely not do so.  During the weekend, on Saturday I plan to go bicycle riding outside for exercise.  A typical week.","My conversation partner was easier to talk to than expected, she gave off a very open vibe.  I see myself as being closed off and kind of cynical, though I try not to be, I worry I came off as such.  It is difficult for me to meet new people and my personality is usually an acquired taste and I don't make a great first impression.  It can be difficult for me to make friends, but she was very nice, and easy to talk to.  ","I felt I had run out of things to talk about, in my personal life I am usually not one to talk unless I have something to say.  I never talk just to do so or hear my own voice, small talk does not come easily for me.  Until I get to know someone, then my dry/witty sense of humor comes out.  Also this is only the second time I have ever had a webcam interaction.  I don't even really like talking on the phone, so I have avoided ""facetime"" and similar programs.  It feels awkward to me, though that's more a problem with myself than the medium.

I intend to be productive and complete a significant amount of my coursework. I also see myself keeping busy with hobbies, such as watching new shows with my mom, practicing the guitar, and taking a few breaks to go for a run outside.","I think our conversation went well, because we were both laid back and open minded. Both my partner and I did a good job listening to each other and asking follow up questions to keep a steady flow. There were no awkward pauses in the conversation, except when deciding when to end the conversation.","I cannot pinpoint any aspect that did not particularly work well in the conversation. If anything, the only thing that did not work as well would be that we sometimes did not know how to relate to each other. This was overcome, as we found each other's differences interesting but it sometimes just caused a pause in the conversation.",3.0,4.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,8.0,6.0,40.0,60.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,7.0,9.0,9.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,3.0,4.0,25.0,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,female,4.0,white,masters_degree,1.0,,8.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.0,6.666666666666667,,1.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,5.0,4.666666666666667,1.6666666666666667,5.0,4.333333333333333,5.0,4.666666666666667,1.0,4.333333333333333,,
