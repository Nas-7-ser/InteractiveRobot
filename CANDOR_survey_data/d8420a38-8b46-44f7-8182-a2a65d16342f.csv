We would attempt to leave the house for a road trip to change our routine for once. Continue to be positive and boost my spouse's positive emotions at the same time. Have a couple of phone conversations with my friends.,I think it takes two positive people to have a meaningful conversation. We were both on the same page and share some common interests. It definitely made the conversation a lot easier. It would also require one of the conversation partners to do more of the leading to carrying a lengthy dialogue.,"There were no issues we the conversation. We both showed up on time and began to chat the moment we were on. No video lag, distorted voices and such. I've got nothing more to add. Everything went well. The channel was set up perfectly.

But I see the rest of my week going pretty well! I am just going to chill, watch some movies, or stand up comedians and smoke enough weed to sedate a small elephant. I also really need to shop so there is that.  ",Well Joe seemed willing to engage and hold a conversation with me. He laughed with me a lot and really that is what I look for when I have a conversation with someone. We didn't have too much in common but we also had some things in common as we both have been to Spain and Portugal. ,"Well, I felt like maybe my partner is a little shy or was unsure of what to discuss. I just felt a reservation there, which then I have a tendency to overcompensate and talk a lot more than I should have.
