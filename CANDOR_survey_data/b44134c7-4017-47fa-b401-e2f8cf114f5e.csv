Mostly, I see the rest of my week being relaxing and moderately entertaining.","I think we were able to find some common topics to discuss after a bit of effort at the beginning. Once we were able to find a topic, I feel we were able to keep the conversation going with minimal effort and a moderate amount of equal input. I think the conversation went fairly well in response to us having some similar views on the topics.","The flow of the conversation was okay but rough at the start. Finding something to talk about stunted the conversation a bit and made it difficult to relate and feel comfortable with each other.
