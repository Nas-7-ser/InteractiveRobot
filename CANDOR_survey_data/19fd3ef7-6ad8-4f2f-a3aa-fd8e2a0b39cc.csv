My assigned partner was very conversational, and both of us got an equal chance at speaking and learning from their perspective. I think it was a good quality conversation.","Among the plentiful, fruitful topics we discussed there were very few times where we had a moment of silence due to neither of us knowing what to say to each other.

I was extremely busy this past week, so I need some recovery time! I have a few virtual events scheduled (three online hangouts and a yoga class), but I don't have many projects to work on outside of that. I'm also feeling a little run down from having been so busy over the past couple weeks that I need some time to just relax. (Especially now -- have to keep the immune system supported!)","What worked well about the conversation is that the two of us were both interested in what the other person had to say but also willing to talk quite a bit ourselves. I think we had a pretty enjoyable handing back and forth of the floor, so to speak. We also both had interesting things in our lives to talk about (his studies, my work in theater, both of our international travel). And we were both willing to open up about how we're feeling about the current situation without getting too in the weeds about politics or other more stressful aspects of it.","It took us a little while to get the conversation off the ground, so the beginning part felt a bit awkward. I was also unsure in the beginning because it was clear that my conversation partner was not insignificantly younger than I am, so I was worried that we might not have much common ground. Because of this being a study, I also sometimes got suspicious about whether this was in some way a set-up and wondered if I was being judged in some way and would get in my head about it.
