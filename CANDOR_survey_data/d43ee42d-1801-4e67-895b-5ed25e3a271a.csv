I have a lot of problems to do for statistics which will not be that fun, but it needs to be done. Also, I hope to spend a lot of time at the gym working on my posture and balance.","What worked well in the conversation was that we were both educated and could have deep conversations about a wide array of topics. We spent the time questioning each other's opinions but in a way that made the conversation more fruitful rather than yelling over each other about minor differences, which seems to happen quite a bit in American life.",I don't think there was anything major in our conversation that made it poor. My conversation moved along regardless of any differences we had and there was always time to add in more. What could have worked better was actually if we had more time because I think the conversation was going in an interesting direction.,5.0,5.0,7.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,8.0,6.0,65.0,35.0,6.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,9.0,9.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,,1.0,1.0,5.0,,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,6.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,male,4.0,white,bachelors_degree,1.0,,8.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,28.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.75,6.333333333333333,1.6666666666666667,1.6666666666666667,16.0,11.0,8.0,1.0,3.0,17.0,3.3333333333333335,4.333333333333333,4.0,1.6666666666666667,3.0,3.3333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,4.333333333333333,2.3333333333333335,3.0,,

And the weather is rainy here in NC.,5.0,5.0,4.0,"I am not sure what was in the middle, oh, probably my questions. He said he was influenced by his English teacher, mentioned how amazon makes an obscene amount of profit, thinks he is making an impact on his students... and maybe we got into the pandemic and staying home. ",6.0,6.0,6.0,"We got kind of political, talked about the need to simply disseminate the distilled truth to most people so they don't have to process the high amount of overwhelming info that is available online. He talked about maintaining agency for people, I cited Bob Dylan lyric and mentioned how pandemic response was maybe botched but was difficult to address.

Busy. A lot of child care. Some grading. Some reading. A bath. Cooking. Maybe some quality time with the family. I need to check the weather report to see if I can go camping. I am at a point where I don't have many pressing projects to do. I need to plan a bit for work. I should pick up a ghost pepper from J at work and look into how much capsaicin it contains and share it with my students. I also need to figure out what podcasts to listen to in the car. Hopefully I will sell some chickens or a carpet or two. ,"I think we had similar life experiences, both having been to grad school. I think we both were pretty flexible in what we could talk about. He could come up with answers to my questions. I am not really sure what we were trying to achieve, but I guess I did learn a couple things, for example Russia and China's approach to foreign policy.","He just wouldn't ask me any questions. Normally I wouldn't have any problem with this, and wouldn't want people to make small talk and ask things they don't really care about, but when we are trying to sustain a chat, I need some help because I am not intrinsically good at this.
