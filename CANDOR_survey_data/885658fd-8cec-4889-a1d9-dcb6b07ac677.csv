We sort of just started talking about pets, I think. I am honestly having trouble remembering what topic was started with.

Pets, life, travel, politics, the economy....We covered a variety of topics individually and blended together.",8.0,8.0,8.0,"The end of the conversation seemed mostly focused on politics and the economy.

I will definitely look into a few things that were discussed in this most recent conversation. I hope to accomplish a few productive things and make use of my time. The ultimate goal is to do more this week than I did last week.,I think almost everything worked well. Our conversation went very well and was very fluid. We discussed a range of topics that we both seemed to respond well to. Neither of us seemed to have an extreme opposition to each other's viewpoints. There were no noticeable gaps in the conversation and no awkward silences.,"There wasn't much that didn't work well. I feel like I may have talked longer or over them at certain times, so I think I could have been better about sharing the talking time more.

Adam talked about travel and other cultures and religions, and after awhile I brought up Humanism, especially the Zoom meetups by the Minnesota and Phoenix humanist groups.

Otherwise I have lots of unscheduled time and will be enjoying the cooler Arizona weather as I work in my yard.","Adam was interesting and was good at telling stories.  I mean true events, but related in a smooth, clear, and interesting fashion.  I enjoyed talking with him and even when I noticed the time had passed 30 minutes I decided to keep going as long as he wanted, or until it was time for me to tend to my chores and head out to pickup my grocery order.","Adam kind of jumped in telling me in detail about his 6 cats before we even introduced ourselves.  I didn't mind, but I think he missed that an overview and a briefer dive into details might be more appropriate at the very beginning of a conversation in which 2 people just met for the first time.
