Stressful times up ahead, and a short break after.","We had enough to talk about to keep the conversation going. There was some silence at times but she did a decent job breaking them. There was some good conversational dynamics playing, and by the middle of the call it was easy enough to change topics off of each other smoothly.","It was clear she was tired, to no fault of her own. Awkward silences did happen a bit at the beginning, though by the middle they stopped occurring. There wasn't much interest-delving up until this point either, which I think is the best way to keep a conversation going.
