I spend a lot of time online reading. I'll watch some TV. My dad will come over on the weekend. I do expect to have a bit more to do next week for Thanksgiving. I'm not sure if that will be a positive or negative impact on me. I generally enjoy holidays, but I'm now the person who does most of the cooking/shopping/etc for my household and I'm not sure how that will work out for Thanksgiving.",We were both friendly and conversation flowed easily. We had similar interests in video games and pets to talk about. We were both willing to pause and listen to what the other person had to say when we overlapped in speaking. I felt like we were both in a positive mood that helped. ,"The biggest issue with the conversation might have been overlapping each other while talking, but I wasn't always sure how much might have been the technology and how much was our speaking patterns. I also worried about a couple of things about myself. I accidentally steered the conversation to education right after she said that previous conversations had gone down that depressing path.

","When we talked about mutual interests, such as pets or video games, the conversation was a bit easier. We talked about TV shows we watched, but neither of us watched the same shows so it wasn't really a conversation as much as us telling the other person about the show we watched","We didn't have anything natural to talk about.
