The video did not cut out, witch is also a plus. I like that we found things to talk about and she was very talkative, very high energy and very easy to talk to.

Melissa didn't get to do much with her day because of the weather. We then shifted to talk about the areas of the U.S. we live in. The weather is getting cooler in VA, where she lives, but it might still be muggy a little. She spent her day watching tv but didn't disclose what she watched. She is a home care nurse but didn't have to work today. I told her about my day - working a little and answering emails and then going to the library. We then started to talk about books. I did most of the talking.",3.0,5.0,3.0,"We talked about authors; Neil Gaiman and Stephen King. Melissa likes horror books and has read some Stephen King, but none of the books that I mentioned. I recommended Desperation and the Regulators and she said she would check them out. We discussed the Sandman graphic novels by Neil Gaiman, which she's read and enjoyed. She said she liked how it discussed issues that people deal with. I recommended American Gods and gave a brief description of the plot. She shared that she likes to watch tv shows on TLC and the History Channel. She's interested in 'the unknown.' I brought up aliens and space and how it's cool that we don't know much. We talked about signs of alien life on Jupiter and underground rivers on either Mars or Venus; neither of us could remember which. I asked about an observatory or planetarium in her area but she stated doesn't have access to either.",4.0,4.0,6.0,"We talked about where Melissa is from. She grew up in Milford, New Jersey and moved to Virginia when she was 10. Once she turned 18, she moved from Virginia and travelled to Oregon, California, New York and then Vermont. When I asked if that was her way of getting out and seeing the world she said, ""yeah, kind of."" I talked about how I'd only ever lived in Kentucky. When we talked about going camping she talked about not having any friends since she's gotten back to VA and how that makes it hard to get back into it. I talked about how hard it is to keep in touch with friends and how we really only get to talk to each other every few months. I asked about travel abroad and talked about visiting Mexico and planning to go to Greece. She has never been outside of the US but would go to Iceland or Tokyo if she had the chance. She doesn't think she wants to live outside of the US. Her last question was, ""if you could do something illegal without getting in trouble, what would it be?"" I said breaking into a famous person's house to play with their stuff. She said robbing the rich and giving to the poor.

I don't anticipate any major hiccups at work, even though I have several projects in the air. I'll actually physically go into my office, so that will be a nice break in routine. After work I'll come home to spend time with my children which will be simultaneously fun and exhausting. I just bought a bunch of new books to read, so that will be a treat.","Honestly, very little worked well. I had to carry the majority of the weight of the conversation - but I do think that one aspect worked out well. I maintained a friendly attitude and she was able to at least give cursory responses to questions and prompts provided during the course of our meeting. I also talk a lot in general, so I didn't feel the anxiety that I normally feel about having to be conscientious about not interrupting.",My conversation partner seemed very shy or maybe self conscious during our conversation. There was a lot of reticence to disclose a lot of her personal opinions about topics and we didn't really get very into anything. It was a struggle at times to find ways of engaging her for the fully 25 minutes.
