I imagine that the week will kind of be slow for me because the weather is getting colder and the coronavirus is getting more widespread and so I am not likely to leave my house very much. To be honest, I feel like this will be emotionally and mentally taxing on me this week.","I feel like each of us were good conversationalists. We started talking about where each other lives, and then when I asked her what she did for a job, it turned out that she is a caregiver for disabled people in a group home. Because I am disabled myself, we had a lot to talk about and it was generally a very good conversation.","I feel like I wish I had more chances to ask her questions. She was asking me a lot of questions but I was genuinely interested in her and would have liked to ask her more questions. Other than that, I really do not feel like there was a lot of negative things that happened during the conversation.",5.0,5.0,9.0,9.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,3.0,9.0,9.0,6.0,60.0,40.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,9.0,9.0,3.0,1.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,,1.0,2.0,5.0,,2.0,,1.0,4.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,male,2.0,white,bachelors_degree,4.0,,10.0,10.0,2.0,,False,,,34.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,7.0,,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.3333333333333335,4.0,2.3333333333333335,4.666666666666667,3.3333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,4.333333333333333,4.0,3.0,4.333333333333333,,

At my job, I have to plan a Thanksgiving feast so it will be a little bit stressful. There are a few events coming up as well such as, bowling and movie day with my residents and staff members. Overall, it should be fun but busy.","What worked well with the conversation was that we were able to understand each other in terms of my career. With my job, I work with people with intellectual and physical disabilities in group homes. My partner had lived in group homes previously. In that regard, he understood exactly what my job entailed. For our conversation we talked about our experiences and our different perspectives. ","Other than our similarity with working with people with disabilities/having a disability, we did not have too many common interests. I asked questions to continue the conversation. His responses to my questions did not give me too much to work with. I also thought that the questions that I asked were very general and something you would have with ""small talk.""
