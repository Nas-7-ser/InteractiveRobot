She had lost her job and was currently looking for a new one. I was learning to be in a healthcare center during the pandemic.,6.0,6.0,7.0,"In the middle of the conversation, we talked about why we chose our selected careers. she told me that she watched a show about squids and was hooked on to biology ever since. I told her I loved being in science but I didn't love biology and chose a happy medium of biochemistry.",9.0,7.0,8.0,"At the end of the conversation, we talked about what we would like to do for our future careers. She was considering becoming a teacher for 6-10yr olds or in a best-case scenario go into a research position. I talked about going back to school and start to prepare to go to med school or PA school.",6.0,4.0,9.0,6.0,9.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,81.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,1.0,8.0,7.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,7.0,8.0,7.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,5.0,6.0,8.0,9.0,8.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,7.0,7.0,9.0,8.0,6.0,7.0,"For the rest of the week, I see that I'm gonna be working a lot. There's gonna be a lot of things and then we had to be doing so it's gonna be very busy for me. I will probably kind of work more towards my goal of going back to school and seeing what requirements I still have to do. And I talk to the people I need to talk to you in order to figure out whether or not I want to go into medical school or a physician's assistant school.",So what I think works really well with this conversation was that we both came from a science background we both really look at facts instead of using our emotions. we were also really friendly people so it was not hard to get to know one another and it seemed that we were similar people.,So what did not work well between me and my partner was mostly just in the beginning when we were first talking to each other. I think with any conversation that you start with a new person just to get to know each other makes it a little bit difficult. But once we were able to break the ice it wasn't that hard to get to know each other.,5.0,4.0,4.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,55.0,45.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,9.0,9.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,6.0,,,5.0,,1.0,2.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,female,4.0,hispanic_or_latino,bachelors_degree,1.0,,5.0,6.0,2.0,,False,,,25.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,6.375,6.0,1.3333333333333333,1.6666666666666667,23.0,10.0,5.0,3.0,0.0,30.0,2.0,4.666666666666667,3.0,2.0,3.6666666666666665,3.0,4.666666666666667,4.333333333333333,2.3333333333333335,4.333333333333333,,

I will wake up, east some breakfast and then study online for a few hours. I'll have lunch, then spend some time looking for a job before settling on whatever catches my eye in netflix. I'll have some dinner, possibly a drink, and then settle down to relax with my partner while watching some youtube. Same stuff, different days. Life is pretty monotonous when you're unemployed and quarantining. ","Asking questions is always a good way to get a conversation going. The pandemic makes it easy to start off with common ground and you can get a feel for how the person reacts in a social setting. From there you can expand to questions that are related to the pandemic, such as what you do and how you spend your spare time. It was very helpful that both of us had a lot in common and could really understand the other persons situation. ","As with meeting any person for the first time, it can be difficult to get the ball rolling with conversation. You're sort of guessing what sort of topics will be hit or miss while also trying to be personable and let the other person have a voice in the conversation as well.
