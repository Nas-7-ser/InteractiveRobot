Friday will start for me at 4:30 in the morning when my niece is dropped off. I take care of her in the morning get her up for school, fed, and dropped off. I also during the course of the morning with my niece will be picking up my nephew and taking him to school. We do the same round of kid action after school. The kids will go off to their respective fathers homes for the weekend. Then I can finally catch up on sleep and do some of my own life maintenance on the weekend.",Oh my gosh it was really amazing! The young lady that I was matched with had a ton in common with me. We are both cat lovers and I got to see her cat very early in the conversation. We had a lot of things in common and it was really easy to talk to her. She seemed like such a great person and if this was a different situation I would definitely have tried to get some contact information and stay in touch with that person. It is pretty rare that I get along with somebody like a house on fire right out of the gate and I was really glad to talk to this wonderful young lady.,"There was literally nothing that didn't work. With a lot of people it would be super awkward trying to find common conversational ground. After seeing her cats and getting the discussion going about our respective cat life experiences, it was really easy for the conversation to take off. Everything that came up was really easy and natural after that. We had a very similar ideals on certain things and she was the type of person I would like to have as a friend.",4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,9.0,9.0,7.0,9.0,4.0,55.0,45.0,6.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,6.0,4.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,,1.0,2.0,4.0,23.0,,,5.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,9.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,female,6.0,mixed,bachelors_degree,1.0,,6.5,8.0,2.0,,False,,,44.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,6.125,7.0,2.0,1.6666666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,4.333333333333333,4.333333333333333,2.6666666666666665,5.0,2.3333333333333335,5.0,4.666666666666667,3.6666666666666665,5.0,,

They were very friendly and open, and good at keeping the conversation going. I was worried there would be awkward silence, but there wasn't. We were able to keep finding things to talk about.","It was just awkward speaking to someone new and knowing we had to meet a certain timeframe at first.
