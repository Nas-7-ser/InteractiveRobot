I hate this time of the week because work is looming although I think (and hope) it will be a relatively easy week at work. I did a lot of stress eating during the election and am looking forward to cooking myself some healthy meals this week - I always feel better both mentally and physically when I eat well.,My partner and I both love dogs! It was nice to find some common ground on that toward the end of the conversation because it did take us some time to get there. But it worked well because we were both chatty enough to full several full sentences together instead of giving one-word answers.,I was really nervous at first because he seemed super quiet. I remember looking at the clock on my computer and seeing that it was 9:02 and thinking I had no idea how we were going to make it another 23 minutes.

I don't foresee anything too strange happening. With Covid, I've been feeling a bit lower energy than I did before, but given that all of my work is done online, I've been able to keep up. I think I'll still be tired as the week goes on, but there isn't much that can be done about that. ","We were able to both take turns to express our thoughts. Neither of us were drowning out the other, which, in my opinion, is a key to any decent conversation. In addition, we talked a lot about ourselves, which I think helped us open up more because we were able to get a good read on each other before asking any more questions. ","I don't think either of us were as eloquent as we liked. We discussed in our conversation, but both of us are introverts. There were a lot of filler words such as ""like"", ""um"" and etc. In addition, I think we struggled to find any common ground because both of us were too nervous to say anything that would reach the middle ground.
