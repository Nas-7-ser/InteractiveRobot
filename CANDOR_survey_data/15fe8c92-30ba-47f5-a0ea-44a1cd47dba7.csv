I am also recently motivated to be more productive in regards to my classwork and hobbies.","Matt is very good at giving off a non-judgemental aura, so whenever I spoke I didn't feel as though he wanted me to stop nor did I ever feel like he was annoyed. We were both pretty good listeners, allowing the other to speak until they stopped and resuming when there was a comfortable pause or silence. We also have similar views on things that are central to our current situations, which guided most of the conversation. ","The only times I felt like the conversation was a bit stilted was when I interrupted Matt. I did this 2 times, I think. I was too excited to respond to what he had just said. There was also a moment where I think I spoke for a bit too long but Matt didn't really seem to mind.

To bond with someone else about the same misery we've all been living with and dealing with was a nice therapeutic break.,Because the person was friendly it was easy to start chatting and once you got a feeling of their level of empathy and were potentially on the same brain wave lengths it was easier to open up and discuss and have a nice going back and forth conversation even about the crap pandemic we're currently in.,There was not really any issues - it went without any hitches. There was no real lag in conversation or from technology. The talk kept flowing pretty well and we obviously made it to a little over 50 minutes in general chatting without even trying. So that was a pleasant surprise. I was worried about myself keeping going and hitting that time limit but it went by very fast and even over time.,5.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,3.0,60.0,40.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,9.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,4.0,4.0,25.0,,,6.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,male,4.0,white,associate_degree,1.0,,5.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,38.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,2.0,2.0,6.375,6.0,1.6666666666666667,1.6666666666666667,30.0,10.0,3.0,8.0,5.0,36.0,3.0,4.0,3.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,4.0,5.0,4.333333333333333,2.3333333333333335,4.333333333333333,,
