The rest of the weekend will be spend doing work. ,"I think what worked well is that we had similar interests and similar viewpoints about things. I think when I mentioned that I was studying mechanical engineering, that sparked something in my partners mind that gave him more things to talk about. I think it was good that we had similar interests. ","I think he was a little shy, which is fine because I think that he carried the conversation well. I do feel like in the beginning I kind of had to ask more questions to get him to be a little more response. I think the conversation was fine but it did feel a little impersonal.
