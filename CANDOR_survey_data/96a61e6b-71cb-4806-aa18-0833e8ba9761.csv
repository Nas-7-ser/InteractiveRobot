She was disappointed by the reduction of business travel.   ",7.0,6.0,7.0,WE were running out of things to say.  She is getting out there going to a painting class with a friend and will shortly be visiting her family.  Since she has a virtual job I said she can really work from anywhere so I suggested trying to travel.    ,5.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,72.0,2.0,19.0,9.0,4.0,3.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,2.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,The weather here is quite rainy so I see a lot of time in from of the computer.

My wife and I will try to have a dinner or two out as well.  The week will go as good as can be expected. ,What worked the best about the conversation was getting to know what about Christie.  Where she lived and what she did.   Her current situation.  What also worked well was relating to the use of masks and how we felt about the pandemic in general.  We seemed to be on the same page on the current state of affairs. ,I definitely felt I did too much talking and not enough listening. That is what happens when I'm in a situation where I feel I have to talk.  Sometimes I think about filling the time. I should have asked more questions about her or we should have agreed to take turns.

I think he is a decent guy and he seemed like a chatterbox who enjoys talking.  So it took the pressure off me a bit, and we were able to talk without silence breaks.","I think he is more liberal and he mentioned CNN, and I also felt like he talked too much, trying to overtake the conversation at times.
