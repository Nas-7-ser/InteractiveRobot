I have to see a few doctors such as a physical therapist, therapist, and allergist before I move in with my boyfriend and start up at my job in my field which is working as a Teacher's Assistant at a Public High School in the Northwest Suburbs of Illinois. ","I think what worked really well was that I got to be paired up with someone EXTREMELY interesting. He was Teacher's Assistant/Graduate Student from Berkley, California who was studying Epitomology (sp?) and Statistics of Diseases within Public Health and a focus in Biostatistics which is exactly what is so relevant in today's society with the Pandemic. I found it therefore extremely interesting!","I think the lack of distractions helps quite a bit in helping me focus on my chat partner. Also, I think him being well educated helped the conversation flow quite nicely. Finally, I think the fact that he was around my age with similar viewpoints and values was also another way that helped facilitate the conversation!",9.0,9.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,50.0,50.0,5.0,6.0,9.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,9.0,9.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,,2.0,,4.0,20.0,,,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,9.0,8.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,female,4.0,white,masters_degree,1.0,,8.0,8.0,1.0,N/A I did not know this person!,False,,,31.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,7.0,7.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.333333333333333,5.0,3.0,2.3333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,4.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,,

I am excited because I will have a few days off and so I would be willing to do something like this again! It really would be a highlight of my week.","I think what worked well was the fact that we were around the same age and also both college educated. We also connected on a few key points like the fact that my family is from the same region as her family, and connected on how we think the world is at right now.",Pretty much everything went great! I guess the only thing I would think of is we were a little confused if we were supposed to stay on the line while we were completing the survey.
