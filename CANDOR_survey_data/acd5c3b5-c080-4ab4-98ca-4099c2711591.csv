I see myself working as usual. I see myself watching tv. I see myself maybe writing. I see myself playing The Sims 4. I think I will have an okay ish week. I don't expect to week to be really that surprising or anything like that.,That we seemed to get along. I liked talking to her. I think not having prompts or anything allowed us to really get to know one another and talk about what was really made the conversation successful. I liked not being constricted. I just think that was really smart about that.,I think the biggest problem was not having a set of prompts to focus on. That we had to kinda guess what we had to talk about. I also wish I had disclosed a personal thing to her because of a certain topic that was broached.
