For instance, in the beginning I could hear my voice through an echo and so I asked him to turn down his volume so I wouldn't have to hear myself and he obliged nicely. ",I think I was a bit nervous and jittery at the beginning as I've been a little jittery these past few days.  The video and audio quality were really good and that wasn't an issue at all.

I had some preconceived notions before the chat the Corona Virus would come up in our conversation, and it did, but it did not dominate it. We did have a couple times where we talked over each other, but over all I think we communicated rather effectively.","I really did not have a chance to ask him what he did for a living or what he liked to do before we started talking about Corona Virus.
