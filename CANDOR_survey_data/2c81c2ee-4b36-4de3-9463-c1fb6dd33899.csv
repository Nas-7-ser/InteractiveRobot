It was helpful that we were both younger people, and lived on the same coast so we were familiar with each other's geography. I think it was also helpful that we've both travelled a lot, because that became a main point of conversation. ","Not much! I think it was mainly normal zoom issues, like talking over each other accidentally or that kind of thing. I think we'd get along very well in person. I could have talked a little bit less, but I think we were fairly evenly split. It was overall a good conversation.

Plus, this allowed us to avoid the awkward introduction phase that can sometimes happen in a conversation. I also think focusing on those commonalities, approaching things with curiosity, and sharing stories back and forth worked really well. ","Honestly, I think the conversation was great and I don't think there was anything that didn't work super well. I guess the only thing that made it less than optimal is, unlike real life, there isn't really an expectation of talking to each other or seeing each other again, which can make conversations feel pointless for some individuals.
