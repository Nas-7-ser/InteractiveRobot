Though I have to say I figured out that you set up guys with girls for some reason, probably to see if the convo would be awkward.  But she was awesome, I'd love to talk to her more.",Absolutely no issues it was a great conversation.  She also had a pretty cool dog.

The week is almost done, so I'm excited about that. Work will be pretty busy tomorrow, but the weekend should be pretty fun. I plan on hanging out with friends and family and maybe having a few drinks. I really enjoy the weekends very much. ","I think we got along great and he was a great conversationalist. I feel like I could have continued talking to him for quite some time and never get bored. He was very friendly and open, and we enjoyed talking about tv shows and the areas we lived together. He would be someone I would be friends with. ",I honestly can't think of something that didn't work well. Everything worked well and the conversation kept flowing. There were no technical issues to report. I wish I had longer than the 25 minutes to have chatted with my partner. It was a really good and fun experience.
