I’m going to rest and try to get over the illness I have. I’ve got to do some online shopping tomorrow for groceries. I feel better mentally going into the weekend after doing this chat. I’m also going to watch a couple of movies. ,The thing that worked well was that were both really friendly people and are comfortable talking to people we don’t know. We learned things about one another and found things we had in common. We talked about politics without talking about which party we are for and that worked well. ,This is always the hardest question to answer. If anything was a little weird it was my fault because I was in the same room as someone and I was telling my chat partner a figure and asked the person what the number was and I think it was strange that I wasn’t alone. ,6.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,9.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,5.0,55.0,45.0,6.0,3.0,1.0,8.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,6.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,25.0,,,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,7.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,female,4.0,white,bachelors_degree,4.0,,11.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,40.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.375,6.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,2.3333333333333335,4.333333333333333,5.0,3.3333333333333335,4.333333333333333,4.333333333333333,3.0,4.0,,

I am finishing up my last week at a job before starting a new job so it will be a time to say goodbye to current coworkers and the normal anxiety that comes with meeting new coworkers and figuring out what exactly the new job entails.,I think having video obviously worked well because we were able to see each other and see each other's facial expressions. It also worked well that we both had engineering backgrounds so there were some common areas of conversation about schooling and such. It also worked well that we are both kind and caring people who had no pretentions about our chat.,There isn't anything that didn't really work. The audio and video worked great. The only small hiccup that we had was when her phone rang and it momentarily paused the video on the iPad that she was using. Everything worked smoothly. There were no technical issues or glitches to speak of.,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,8.0,4.0,60.0,40.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,8.0,8.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,17.0,,,4.0,12.0,,,3.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,6.0,2.0,8.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,male,3.0,white,masters_degree,1.0,,10.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,39.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.25,5.333333333333333,2.0,2.6666666666666665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,5.0,4.666666666666667,1.6666666666666667,3.0,2.6666666666666665,4.333333333333333,3.6666666666666665,2.3333333333333335,4.666666666666667,,
