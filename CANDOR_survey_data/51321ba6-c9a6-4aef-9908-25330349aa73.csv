I'm feeling pretty good at the moment and it is Friday (I don't work on Saturday and Sunday).  I am also excited to check out a new show that my chat partner recommended.  I am still under a stay at home order, but I think that I can be productive and have some fun with my family during the rest of the week.  ","I think that it worked well that we had some things in common, mainly that we were both under a stay at home order.  We were able to talk about what we were doing during the time we have been spending under quarantine.  I also think that it was nice that we had a few differences to talk about - for example she likes art and that gave us something to talk about.","I think that the conversation went well, so this question is a bit difficult. There were a few moments when we kind of ran out of things to say, but it seemed like one of us quickly came up with a new topic.  I think that we didn't have as many TV shows that we watched in common, if we had we could have talked more about that.",5.0,5.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,50.0,50.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,7.0,8.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,5.0,,1.0,2.0,5.0,,1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,,female,4.0,white,masters_degree,1.0,,8.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,34.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.25,6.333333333333333,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.3333333333333335,4.666666666666667,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.666666666666667,3.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,4.666666666666667,,

I plan on taking time to connect with my family, both in person and virtually. One thing I miss most about quarantine is getting to see my elderly grandma often. I also have mother day plans with my sister and mom now that we’re in a less restrictive state.","A lot! I felt that we had enough in common to talk easily and she was a good conversation partner. We could talk about teaching, family, and the current shut downs. We connected about similarities and also differences, like the areas we lived in. She was easy to talk to and friendly.
