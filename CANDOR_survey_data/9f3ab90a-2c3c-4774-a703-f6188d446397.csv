In addition to these interviews, I am going into the city to explore for the first time since lockdown/quarantine happened. It will be exciting to see what has changed. ","What worked well in the conversation was that my partner was very personable and easy to talk to. While there was an age gap, there were topics that we could both talk about and relate to, as well as learning other interesting things about the other person. Overall, she was very enjoyable to talk to. ","I think because of the age gap, there were certain topics that we couldn't directly relate to like if I was talking about my experiences in college or graduate school, she would not directly relate, she would relate to my experiences through her children who both are in university currently.

The library is reopening to return books, and next week, we'll be able to have no-contact hold pick ups! I'm looking forward to a Zoom class tonight and Zoom knitting group tomorrow. Also, the weather is supposed to be nice -- not too humid, nice and warm. ","My conversation partner was friendly. We had a minute of initial awkwardness, but we found a few things to talk about very quickly, and the conversation never really flagged. She was open to talking about her school and work situations, and helped me understand her interesting arrangement for going to law school through her employer.","The conversation worked well overall, so there isn't much to say. Priscilla and I don't have a ton in common, but I was able to relate to her situation because my children are in a similar stage of life.
