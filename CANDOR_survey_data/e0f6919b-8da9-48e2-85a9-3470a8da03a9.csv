She asked open ended questions. We were able to find common ground even though she was younger than me. She had traveled further than I, so it was interesting to learn about the places she had been. If there was a lull in the conversation, we were both able to easily fill it. ","The only thing that made it difficult was that there was an age gap, so I am sure it was harder for her to relate to my position in life as my eldest is probably close to her age. Even that was not too much of a challenge as we found plenty of things to talk about.
