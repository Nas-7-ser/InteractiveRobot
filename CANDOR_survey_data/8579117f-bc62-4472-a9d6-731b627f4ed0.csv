I am fairly busy and have to work, but otherwise am flexible to enjoy time with family. I also look forward to riding my bike and going to see my boyfriend a couple hours away in Seattle. The weather does not look great, but it still should all go well.","What worked well is that my partner and I were very animated people and had a lot in common. She was very warm and receptive to the things I was talking about and we bonded over a shared interest in languages. Most importantly though, we were both curious about the other and what we had in common. ",There was not anything that did not work in my opinion. She was a very warm and interesting person to talk to with an awesome personality. We spent twice the recommended time chatting and I could totally see being friends with her if we were closer to each other. Overall I really enjoyed my time chatting. ,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,9.0,5.0,50.0,50.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,9.0,9.0,2.0,2.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,,1.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,female,4.0,white,some_college,2.0,,7.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,28.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6.625,7.0,,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,4.333333333333333,2.3333333333333335,4.333333333333333,2.0,4.333333333333333,5.0,4.0,2.3333333333333335,5.0,,

I have been productive so far so I can see this trend continuing. I will talk to a few friends, hopefully clean my room, answer more studies on prolific, and I will clean my art room. I will also be working on listing a bunch of items to my online sites!",The conversation worked well because we were both super positive. She was an incredible person to talk to and was very optimistic. It was very refreshing to finally have a woman as my conversation partner that also loves traveling and learning new languages. She took interest in my career path and it was very nice to experience.,Everything worked well. I never had a better conversation partner and someone that I would want to spend almost an hour talking to. It was great to feel appreciated and understood by someone and she is a great person.
