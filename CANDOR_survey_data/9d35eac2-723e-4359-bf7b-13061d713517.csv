I got sort of lost in the flow of the conversation being so focused on this be she seemed interest so it didn't occur to me to stop.,7.0,5.0,8.0,She mentioned that we were over our time limit and I wanted to mention one more thing about the homebuilding aspects that I was talking abourt and discussed a certain YouTuber that is building his own home and recording a video diary of the process.,6.0,4.0,7.0,5.0,8.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,75.0,2.0,65.0,50.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,1.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,7.0,8.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,7.0,8.0,7.0,8.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,5.0,8.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,I have a rather strict routine right now because I am saving for various specific purchases. I don't have anything planned that is out of the ordinary other than maybe a purchase during the Amazon Prime Day sales so I believe that the rest of the week will likely follow the routine that I have been keeping.,"Time passed very quickly because we both seemed to be interested in the idea of travel and living somewhere else. Since I have both done so and was planning on doing so again this year had it not been for the pandemic, I was able to discuss what I would have done. I believe our mutual interest made that discussion easy.",The conversation went pretty well. Perhaps I could have paid more attention to ask questions about her situation and desire to eventually move somewhere else but had lost track of time so we ended the conversation before that took place. She did mention several things about her current situation and eventually moving but most of it was me talking.,5.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,5.0,7.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,2.0,75.0,25.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,2.0,4.0,25.0,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,male,3.0,white,associate_degree,1.0,,6.0,6.0,2.0,,False,,,45.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.25,5.333333333333333,2.0,1.0,28.0,8.0,9.0,3.0,0.0,12.0,4.0,3.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,1.0,5.0,3.3333333333333335,4.333333333333333,4.333333333333333,2.3333333333333335,4.0,,

I told him I lived in the mountains of California and used to live in Minnesota.",6.0,7.0,7.0,"In the middle of the conversation, my chat partner told me about his plans to build a house off the grid and a story about a gentleman in Nebraska who built a citrus farm using thermo energy to keep the temperature constant. ",6.0,7.0,7.0,"At the end of the conversation, we talked about how expensive it is to live in California with all of the regulations and taxes.

I will enjoy having free time to do some projects around the house and prepare for when school starts. I will get to spend a lot of time with my family and pets and not have anything really pressing to do. ,"My chat partner was very talkative, so there weren't any awkward pauses. He had a lot of interesting things to tell me about and I learned a little bit about a country that I didn't know anything about. He was pleasant, and enthusiastic about the things he was interested in. ","Though the conversation was interesting, I felt that it was very one sided. I learned a lot about him and his interests and life, but he didn't seem very interested in learning about mine. He was interesting to listen to, but I wouldn't really be interested in having a friend that wasn't also interested in what I have to say.",4.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,2.0,8.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,8.0,7.0,4.0,9.0,20.0,80.0,7.0,3.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,2.0,6.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,20.0,,,5.0,,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,female,4.0,white,some_college,6.0,,8.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,38.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,1.6666666666666667,2.0,27.0,15.0,9.0,3.0,0.0,19.0,4.0,4.666666666666667,2.6666666666666665,1.3333333333333333,4.666666666666667,4.666666666666667,2.6666666666666665,4.0,2.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,,
