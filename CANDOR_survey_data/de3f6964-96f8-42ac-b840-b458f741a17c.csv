I am excited for Halloween with my girlfriend.","I think shifting around different topics until we came to one for which my partner could contribute worked well. Sometimes you can't expect to stick with an initial conversation topic and have that be the focus the entire time, especially if the other person is not interested in it. Once I realized I could get her to talk about her pharmacy studies, I knew that could be a lasting conversation.","Although there were multiple times that my conversation partner helped move the conversation along, I felt like I had to guide it myself, lest I wanted there to be silence.

My breaks probably include watching funny dramas. ,I think it worked well when my partner seemed to notice that we had so much in common and would emphasize what a coincidence nearly every time we talked. I thought that was so funny. It definitely helped that we were from the same area so we had lots more to talk more about things in the area.,I think there was a time when we ran out of things to talk about so the sound went quiet for a bit.
