I expect there to be a number of difficult tasks and tough conversations I have to take part in. I am not looking forward to it. But this conversation really energized me and helped me to smile. I have really needed that and hope it makes the rest of the week look a little brighter.,"Both of us are smart people in professional jobs with an LGBTQ affinity. We also had some familiar geographic overlap in CA that gave us lots to talk about. My partner was also smart, funny, and open to talking. We shared the conversation and both learned a lot about each other. I found my partner interesting and engaging, and we were both equally interested in learning about each other as we were about talking about ourselves.","I was nervous a bit at the beginning and was making small talk while I set my timer. I felt like I wasn't fully focused and I worried that my partner would think it was about them. But we shared a lot of information, and my partner picked up the ball and got things going. It was an amazing talk despite a relatively slow start.",6.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,8.0,7.0,9.0,9.0,5.0,50.0,50.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,,1.0,4.0,5.0,,1.0,3.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,8.0,8.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,male,6.0,white,professional_degree,2.0,,10.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,52.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6.0,7.0,,1.6666666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,1.3333333333333333,4.333333333333333,4.333333333333333,4.666666666666667,4.333333333333333,4.666666666666667,2.0,4.0,,

Work has me a bit stressed out and i want to log into my work email but i decided to just wait until tomorrow. No need in ruining the rest of my weekend. Stress has already taken a bit from me. I just hope all goes well. ,We just had a lot to talk about. I feel like we can talk for hours. He seemed like a very nice guy and I would enjoy him as a friend I would have in real life. It helped that we had some stuff in common and we've been to the same events though we live in different states.,There was nothing that did not work well. The video worked and i know we went over the 25 minutes that we were supposed to complete. My alarm went off then his which was a few minutes behind mine. And then we continued to carry on the conversation until we finished what we were saying.
