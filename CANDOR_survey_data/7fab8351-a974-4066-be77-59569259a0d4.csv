My partner had quite an interesting story about a business scandal that happened to him in the late 2000s. It was very intriguing to hear him narrate this story. Based on this, I see the rest of my week as going very favroably.",The conversation worked well in the sense that me and my partner had quite a lot of things in common. I and him shared a passion for games and that spawned quite a variety of topics that we discussed heavily about. His story about the business scandal was also very intriguing to listen to.,"In general, the actual conversation went quite well. However, some things did not go as smoothly as the conversation went. For example, my partner had numerous connection issues that caused the conversation to be not as smooth as it could have been. As a result of his connection, videos were not smooth either.",2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,5.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,8.0,9.0,4.0,9.0,25.0,75.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,6.0,4.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,,1.0,4.0,5.0,,1.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,10.0,8.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,male,2.0,asian,some_college,7.0,Student,8.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,25.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6.5,7.0,,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.6666666666666667,2.6666666666666665,2.3333333333333335,2.3333333333333335,5.0,4.666666666666667,5.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,,

Boring, slow and there ill be an effort on my part to find something to do. I will probably continue to rattle around my house, doing and redoing projects, and hope that I get good news about a job soon. ","My conversation partner was a good listener. He was young, and seemed interested in my life experiences. He also seemed to be very studious, very busy with school, so I think he has limited experiences to talk about other than that. However, that should not be held against him in any way, as he seems interested and genuine. I will not say it was a one-sided conversation, but just that I perhaps had more to say.","Well, there WERE a few times when the video lagged, and that seemed to drag us down a bit. However, we both tried to stay on topic and keep going. Other than that, there was not much that did not go well. He was an interesting fellow. I wish, upon reflection, I had asked him more about his schooling.
