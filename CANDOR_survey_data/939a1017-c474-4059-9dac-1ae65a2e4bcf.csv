We both grew up in a major city and loved Marvel and Star Wars films. My conversation partner was also very good at keeping the conversation going and asking questions about myself.,One thing that did not work well in the conversation that I just had was that I felt a little shy and hesitant to ask something or transition the topic.

He was a good listener and asked questions and seemed to take an interest when I told him things about my life. He was good at responding to things that I said as well and was able to keep the conversation rolling. ,"I think we have very different backgrouds and interests, so while there really wasn't anything that didn't work well, we weren't into the same kind of movies so we couldn't just talk about that. I'm really into old horror movies and stuff like that so we differed there, but it didn't really cause much of an issue for me at all.
