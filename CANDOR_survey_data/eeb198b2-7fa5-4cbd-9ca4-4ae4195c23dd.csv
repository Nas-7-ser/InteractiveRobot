She had plenty to say, so she was a good convo partner.","Well, the video issues did make the interaction a little less easy to stay engaged, but being of different demographics (I'm significantly older than the convo partner, live in different area) and having less in common maybe constrained the topics we could have discussed if we had more similar experiences.",6.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,5.0,55.0,45.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,7.0,8.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,2.0,,4.0,20.0,,,5.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,,,male,4.0,mixed,associate_degree,1.0,,7.0,6.0,2.0,,False,,,48.0,4.0,,15.0,50.0,35.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,60.0,10.0,20.0,0.0,3.0,6.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,,3.0,,,,4.5,6.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,4.0,3.3333333333333335,4.0,3.6666666666666665,4.0,3.3333333333333335,3.0,3.3333333333333335,romantic_partner,video_chat

I need to study for finals and make up a large number of assignments before the end of this week. My friend is being tested for corona so waiting for the outcome of that will be stressful as well. I will try to minimize my time spent worrying and focus on work.,We were able to find common ground very quickly and each had details and opinions to share. We also were able to introduce new trains of thought and continue our conversation well without much silence in between trains of thought. We were able to bring up new ideas to one another and share our thoughts on one another's experiences.,Not much. At times it was hard to find things to talk about but not often for a long period of time. It also was slightly difficult to have an even-handed conversation because we did speak over one another a couple of times.
