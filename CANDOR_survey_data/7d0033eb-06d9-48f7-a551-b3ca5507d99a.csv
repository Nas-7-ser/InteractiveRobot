I see my week ending with a lot of hours at work and less relaxation time. During this week, I will begin thinking about continuing college for my Master's degree and trying to organize different aspects in my life. ","Carlos was very friendly and understanding. At the beginning, I was ready to have the 25 minute conversation over with, but as we talked more I began to appreciate his company and his advice. I did not expect the conversation to work out well because he was far older than I, but I found that the age difference gave us a different perspective on life. ","I felt that I was not talkative enough. I was too engaged in the conversation and felt I didn't have much to offer.

I have to prepare a presentation and a poster by the 10, then a chapter by the 30. Dreading to be on the computer. I'll go for a long walk today. I'm spending the 4th of July alone, avoiding people and watching TV. There will be lots of opportunities to socialize when the pandemic is over!","I liked Shawn very much. Probably because she's young, sweet, and pretty, and she's a promising student. I felt specially compelled to like her because she's black. I know it's patronizing, but I feel that we owe them a lot. I'm not white, I'm Mexican, but I enjoy white privilege through my husband and the place I live. She probably thought I was some creepy dork giving her unsolicited advice, but I love giving advice to young people, I feel like oh I wish somebody had been nice to me when I was their age, so I start asking questions and giving unsolicited advice and telling young people reasons to feel good and happy about themselves. We didn't have much in common, other than a willingness to have a nice conversation. Well maybe both of us are a little loners. I just wanted her to feel safe and happy.","Everything went well. I would say that the worst moment was when Shawn told me that she's been harassed by clients â€”she delivers pizza. It made me feel powerless and angry at those people. Why would they try to lure such a nice innocent girl into their perversions? But she's smart and know she has a safer position as a cook. I hope everything will go well with her.

At the beginning I think I was asking too many questions, we were just trying to figure out what to talk about. We managed to start talking fluently right away. I enjoyed the experience.
