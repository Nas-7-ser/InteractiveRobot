Talking to a new person helped give me a new perspective on my life and it was really refreshing to talk to someone new for the first time in months. Hopefully I can make progress towards some of the learning goals that I discussed in the previous conversation. ,"We were both the same age and college educated, so it was very easy to talk about school. We've also both lived in Michigan, and she has spent time in Colorado, so that was fun and easy to talk about. In retrospect, I regret not asking my partner more questions about herself, but I didn't want to pry too much and I also wanted to hold up my end of the conversation, so I hope I didn't focus too much on myself!","I haven't had many conversations recently, to be honest, and noticed a few times I kind of lost my train of thought or wasn't sure how coherent I was being at times. There was a moment where I couldn't see her on the screen, so i felt like I should keep talking, but probably ended up saying something stupid. Sometimes it's  bet not to say anything at all,, however some people are sensitive to awkward silences, so maybe that wouldn't have been a better option.",8.0,5.0,8.0,6.0,7.0,3.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,9.0,5.0,50.0,50.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,6.0,8.0,6.0,4.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,,1.0,2.0,4.0,20.0,,,4.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,male,4.0,white,associate_degree,7.0,self employed,8.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,34.0,5.0,,50.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50.0,100.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,5.375,7.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,2.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,5.0,3.0,4.666666666666667,4.333333333333333,2.6666666666666665,5.0,family,in_person

I have a few things planned out for what needs to get done, but I am happy to be able to complete those tasks. Also,it is my birthday on Friday and I have a trip planned for this weekend that I am looking forward to AND spending time with my brother on Friday to-- we are going kayaking! I have not seen him since Christmas.",We had a good back and forth. I was able to relate to topics he brought up and he was able to relate to me. I think it helped us early on that we found a commonality-- we are both from Michigan. And towards the end of our conversation that we have the same kind of cat! But everything in between was pretty cool too.,"I can't think of anything that didn't work as well, but if I have to mention something I would say his eye blinking and head movement. I try not to let that sort of thing affect the conversation I'm having with a person because it its not usually something they can control.
