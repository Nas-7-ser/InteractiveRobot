I am looking forward to this coming Thursday, my cousin is in town for the day.  She has been really careful like me during COVID because we are both the main caretakers for our parents, so I am ok with seeing her and hugging her.

",I think we both kept the conversation going well.  We both asked each other questions and seemed interested in getting to know one another.  We kept the conversation light and not too personal. We would find things that we had in common which was nice.  She was also younger than me and we still we had fun talking. ,I think there was an age difference but not so much of one that it kept us from talking.  She seemed a little shy at first but she also said that she had not done the chat before so I can understand why she was maybe shy.  She looked off to the side alot but it did not bother me.,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,8.0,8.0,3.0,65.0,35.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,8.0,8.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,24.0,,,4.0,22.0,,,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,8.0,8.0,7.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,female,4.0,hispanic_or_latino,masters_degree,1.0,,8.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,47.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.875,6.0,,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,3.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,2.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,2.6666666666666665,4.0,3.6666666666666665,2.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,,

I believe since she works at a university and studies psychology she is very good around people and can make them feel comfortable. There were no awkward silences, and we were both able to share mini-stories on certain topics which were fun to tell/listen to.","I don't believe there was very much that went wrong in the conversation. She might have talked a little too fast for me but it still wasn't a bother at all. She talked quite a bit and the ratio might have been more towards her, but it still felt even enough of a conversation where we were both able to talk and listen.
