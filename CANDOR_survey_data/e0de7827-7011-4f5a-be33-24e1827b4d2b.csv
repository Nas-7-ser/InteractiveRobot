Prior to the chat this evening I was dreading the rest of he work week but now I am looking forward to it. I have work challenges ahead but I am looking forward to tackling them and have a renewed sense of purpose. Definitely a more positive outlook. ,We were both friendly and engaging. We were able to compare and contrast differences geographically and with individual interests. The flow of the conversation worked well and did not feel awkward. We allowed time for the other person to talk or add on to the conversation. We were both respectful and considerate.,Sometimes I felt like I talked too much and did not allow her as much time to talk.  I felt I dominated the conversation and she was a little more quiet so I purposely allowed there to be a silence so she could pick up on a topic or something of interest to her.,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,60.0,40.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,1.0,5.0,,1.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,female,3.0,white,bachelors_degree,1.0,,7.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,50.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.875,6.0,,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.333333333333333,4.666666666666667,4.0,2.0,4.333333333333333,4.0,4.666666666666667,3.6666666666666665,2.0,4.0,,

We also talked about how my conversation partner raises dogs and breeds them (border collies), and a puppy showed up on her side of the video. She introduced the puppy and explained how it's staying with its mother longer because the person who will later own the puppy wanted the puppy to have that longer time. We also talked about dogs and cats in a more general sense (we're both allergic to cats).",7.0,6.0,6.0,"We talked about her son's farm in Snohomish, WA, where he keeps a lot of animals, including 2 horses and 3 goats. There were also parts of the conversation where we talked about her mother's travels, which included going to Antarctica on a cruise. I talked about the fact that I had sold cross stitches to every continent, and about a friend I had who had been in Antarctica on contracts during the summer season when a lot of scientists are at McMurdo. Then we talked about COVID for a long time, because she's a nurse case manager, and I had a lot of interest in hearing more about the topic from a person who's in the field.",8.0,7.0,7.0,"We continued to talk about COVID, and we both wished that this year would end sooner rather than later. We discussed the ways that life has changed, including her 2 high school aged kids doing school virtually from home. She said she didn't think things would ever be quite the same, like they weren't the same after 9/11, but that it would be good to get this behind us. 
At the very end of the conversation, I remembered that the fact that my cross stitches are most popularly microbes was relevant to this conversation and possibly interesting to my conversation partner, so I told her that. Then we said goodbye.",6.0,5.0,9.0,8.0,7.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,79.0,5.0,60.0,65.0,5.0,4.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,1.0,7.0,6.0,8.0,7.0,8.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,7.0,6.0,8.0,7.0,8.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,8.0,9.0,5.0,6.0,"I have a lot of work to do, some of which is new to me and some of which is my regular self employment work. I've put my business on the backburner to learn my new work, which means I need to work during the evenings to get everything done. That makes me feel tired, although I'm a night owl, so if I buckle down, I can do it.
I'm also going on a trip to another state on Sunday, and I have to pack my car very carefully, making sure to bring everything I'll need for myself personally as well as everything I need to keep my business going while I'm away. I will be away for at least 2.5 weeks, but because of quarantine, I may be away from my important things for a month.
I also have a phone call scheduled with my lawyer, and another appointment I can't even remember right now.
In sum, I have a lot of things that need to get done in the next 5 days. It's going to be busy, but I think that I can handle each thing I need to do, and stay focused and organized enough to do a good enough job.","My conversation partner was willing to discuss her work, which I had a lot of questions about. I can imagine that if she had been less willing to discuss her work, we might have had more stilted or awkward moments, though I also was interested in hearing about her dog breeding and her son's farm. 
I think the main thing that really worked for me was that I found what she was saying interesting. I was more interested in hearing about her life than I felt about sharing about my life, so it worked well for me that she took an active role in the conversation and shared a lot about her life. I felt that I got a pretty good beginning picture of several aspects of her life, which was interesting to me.","I probably needed to speak up and share more in order to be an equal partner in the conversation. Sometimes I felt I was saying things mostly because I hadn't said anything substantial in awhile. I didn't feel like I was completely on the same wavelength as my conversation partner, and I blame myself for that.
