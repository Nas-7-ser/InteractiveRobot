It's going to rain everyday so that puts a damper on my mood. The guy I chatted with told me to look forward and don't think about my past mistakes which was really good advice that I will take with me moving forward for sure.,"We had a good conversation. Touched on a good amount of subjects. It was nice that we are from two different parts of the country so could fill each other in and the happenings in our neck of the woods. I feel like we communicated well. He gave good advice. I was struggling on what to talk about a little, but we got a good flow going.","Nothing too much. I felt a little less into to this conversation compared to yesterday, but that was on me not anything to do with him. Once we were able to share some stories and open up more we kept a good conversation flow going. There might have been a few pauses and more abrupt subject changes basically to find something to talk about.",5.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,8.0,5.0,8.0,9.0,7.0,40.0,60.0,5.0,7.0,5.0,3.0,7.0,7.0,9.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,20.0,,,4.0,24.0,,,5.0,3.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,3.0,7.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,male,6.0,white,some_college,2.0,,7.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,30.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.25,6.333333333333333,,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.3333333333333333,3.0,3.0,4.333333333333333,3.6666666666666665,4.0,4.666666666666667,5.0,1.3333333333333333,5.0,,

I will go to work tomorrow and then I will be off for the weekend. I will have an opportunity to relax and enjoy my family. Next week I will have a full schedule of work before going on vacation for the Thanksgiving break.,"The person on the other side that I was conversing with was very kind. He was able to have a conversation with me that was interesting, which made it easy for me to actually be able to engage in meaningful dialogue. I also enjoyed being able to talk to another person who I don't know, who lives in a totally different region than myself.","The interaction between myself and the other person was actually very interesting. The quality of the video was not bad, and could have used some improvement, but overall I enjoyed my time.
