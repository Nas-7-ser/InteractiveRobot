I wrote some goals down on Sunday night for the week as I usually tend to do and I feel I'm on my path. It's only Tuesday so the week is young and I'm feeling positive that I'll do what I need to do this week. ,She was open to conversation and pleasant. She had an interesting background being in Hawaii and also a second-generation Puerto Rican. It stimulated the conversation because I enjoy traveling and talking about other people's backgrounds. She also didn't seem as shy as she said she was and wasn't super awkward. ,"I thought the conversation mostly went well. If I was to nitpick I'd say that age was a factor. I'm 34 years old and live by myself and work full-time. It sounded like she was 19 years old and living with her parents and studying. In that respect, she is not exactly my peer. Her day to day problems are different than my day to day problems. With that said, I still feel we got along well. Also the conversation was quite short so perhaps I didn't get a full picture of her background.

I have started doing activities which I thoroughly enjoy and am not stressing myself about the little things in life. I will get to binge shows with my best friend which shall  be fun.,"Ted was very good at asking questions and elaborating on what I asked of him. Whenever there was about to be a lapse in conversation, he asked a new question or made a new statement to get the conversation rolling. I responded with the same energy that he put out and so the conversation continued quite easily. It also helps that we discussed current events relevant to us both. ","Things mostly went well during the conversation and there were very few lapses. When there was a lapse, it was because a topic which brought up by one or the other which only one of us had information on and so the other could not contribute to. Listening only works when the other person has a lot to say about a specific topic.
