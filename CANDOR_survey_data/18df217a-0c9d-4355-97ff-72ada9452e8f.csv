All of my bills are finally paid and I have just a bit extra to purchase something for myself. I am going to order some old movies and I am looking forward to getting to watch them, in the air-conditioning. ","It worked that my conversation partner and I both had pets in the room and we discussed those for a few minutes, then our lifestyles and families. We had no shortage of things to discuss because her pet jumped on-screen and mine did as well. Pets in the room while talking on camera must be a fairly common thing.  ","Everything seemed to pretty much work, although it is difficult to know what to discuss when time is very limited. I really enjoyed the conversation and Meredith discussing what her life is like in a place (upstate New York) where I have never been. Her mentioning that it isn't hot right now (it is 95 degrees Fahrenheit where I am) was an excellent selling point.",6.0,4.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,9.0,7.0,45.0,55.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,6.0,6.0,9.0,9.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,4.0,5.0,,1.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,7.0,8.0,7.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,female,2.0,white,bachelors_degree,1.0,,8.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,50.0,4.0,,50.0,0.0,50.0,0.0,0.0,50.0,0.0,0.0,50.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.625,6.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,4.333333333333333,3.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,4.666666666666667,family,in_person

I am going to see some of my grandchildren in a few days, and I'm really looking forward to that. We are all going to have a day together on July 4th. I am happy too, that we've finally gotten some rain and I will be able to continue planting flowers in my yard. ","We are both animal lovers and we both had our pets near us during the conversation. My partner was charming and very nice to speak with. There were no awkward silences either. I also prefer to chat with women, and my partner was a woman. Women are easier for me to talk to then men. No one hogged the conversation or interrupted. It was very nice. ","I think everything worked well. The sound and picture quality were good. My dogs did bark a few times, but it was anything that really disrupted the flow of the conversation. My partner was very easy to speak with and we had an easy, comfortable chat. I experienced no issues with my partner or with the quality of the video feed.
