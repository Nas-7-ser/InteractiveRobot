He seemed like a nice, regular gut and I found it easy to relate to his situation and how Covid has impacted his family.  We both shared readily. ","I'm not really sure there was anything that didn't work well, though it was hard to end the conversation... we talked an extra 10 minutes.

I am still trying to get my new work life balance in check, and I feel like I will make some progress toward that goal.  I have some activities planned for the kids, so in the afternoons after school we are going to go to a few parks, and attractions we can enjoy in a socially distant way.  I have been struggling with sleep, but I think the extra physical activity will help with that too.  Overall I would say that my week will be a good one.","Well, we were different in a lot of ways, so those departures gave us something to talk about.  He was very good at listening, and I am quite good at talking.  I felt like I talked way too much, but that is not new.  I tend to be long winded at times, so the fact that he was a patient listener, was good- but I also liked hearing about his life, and was interested in his view on current events. ","Everything worked quite well, there were not a lot of awkward silences, but there were a few.  No real technical issues to speak of.  I talk a lot, so there were times where it felt one sided, but he did not seem to mind, and continued asking me questions.  Over all, the only strange thing was the few silences, where we were waiting to talk, or listen.",6.0,4.0,8.0,6.0,4.0,1.0,7.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,7.0,9.0,6.0,60.0,40.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,6.0,9.0,9.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,2.0,4.0,25.0,,,4.0,4.0,6.0,7.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,male,6.0,mixed,bachelors_degree,1.0,,7.0,6.0,2.0,,False,,,38.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.75,5.666666666666667,2.3333333333333335,1.6666666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.3333333333333335,4.333333333333333,4.666666666666667,2.6666666666666665,4.666666666666667,2.0,5.0,5.0,2.3333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,,
