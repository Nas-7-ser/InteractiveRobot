I have parent-teacher conferences coming up at work this week, and while I very much enjoy talking to parents about their children, we typically only conference with the parents of students who are having difficulties.  I keep a positive attitude and try to focus on the talents and growth these students have made, while trying to address their difficulties. ","My conversation partner was forty years younger than I am and so happy and energetic. He lives in a beautiful state that I had once visited, and I was dying to hear more about it. He had wonderful stories to tell about nature, hiking, and fishing. It was a wonderful conversation. He even moved  his laptop so that I could see his backyard which just so happened to border national forest land. It was incredible. ","There is nothing negative to comment on. My partner was interesting and energetic and I was really entertained by his stories and conversation. We were polite to one another and everything worked out fine. At one point my two little Pomeranians started barking like lunatics, but they were in another room so it wasn't really an issue.

I am on vacation so it is hard to think of anything going bad while Im spending time with my family. The weather could be nicer but thats not that big of a deal. I am going to relax and watch football and play video games and cards with my family. It should be a good week.,There wasn't any super long awkward silences. We talked about interesting things and learned a little more about each other. We had similar experiences even though we live so far apart and have a pretty high age gap. I also believe that we both bought into the program and were nice and tried to have a legit conversation with each other. ,I think that the biggest obstacle for me was the age gap. We didn't talk about it much but it definitely was more awkward then if I was talking to an individual my own age. It was also hard because we lived so far apart to come to a common ground.,1.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,3.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,8.0,8.0,3.0,56.0,44.0,6.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,,2.0,,4.0,24.0,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,male,2.0,white,bachelors_degree,1.0,,6.0,5.0,2.0,,False,,,24.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.125,5.333333333333333,1.0,1.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.666666666666667,4.0,4.333333333333333,1.3333333333333333,3.0,2.6666666666666665,4.666666666666667,4.333333333333333,3.0,4.0,,
