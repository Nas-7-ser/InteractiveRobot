I don't have much to look forward to the rest of this week, but I will try to make the most of it and be productive. I have been stressed to I am looking forward to relaxing and taking some time to myself. ",I think what worked well is that we both shared a little bit of ourselves with each other. We were not too nervous or closed off and both asked each other questions and listened well to each other. We tried not to speak over each other and actively listened and responded in a respectful way. ,"We didn't have too much in common with each other and thus ended up talking about rather general topics, such as weather and were we live. Our conversations were not very deep even for a casual one, and I think it was because we didn't feel too comfortable with each other.

I hope that the air will get better and I'll be able to go out more. Also, I hope to go visit my mom who is disabled and thought she would have to evacuate.","Well, for one the technical aspect kind of worked out, which it didn't last time. Also, in general in these conversations it helps that we both know exactly why we're there and what we have to do. So, there's fairly little awkwardness even if we don't know each other well and don't naturally ""click"" right away. One point of commonality we found was that we are both children of immigrants.","I didn't think we had that much in common and initially there was a slightly forced attempt to engage with each other. Also, my chat partner started talking to me about weather, but as it turns out we are having some pretty catastrophic weather in this state, so I had to tell her about that, which caused me to talk a lot at the very beginning of the conversation.
