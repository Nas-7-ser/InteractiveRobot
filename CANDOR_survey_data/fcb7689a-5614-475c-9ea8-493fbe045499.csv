He works as a ship captain and he's been trying to learn piano. He also did a lot of cooking and baking with a firend during the pandemic. He talked about taking turns cooking with a firend and having zoom meals. I talked a bit about how teaching online is going and what I'm teaching.,8.0,6.0,8.0,We talked a lot about traveling. He has been all over the world both for fun and for work when he worked on a research ship. He menitoned wanting to go to Morrocco and Iceland and Thailand were two trips that he had planned on doing but his trps got cancelled. I talked about some of the places I've been to and where I would want to go if I could.,7.0,6.0,7.0,"We continued talking about traveling. We talked about Japan a bit and how it's harder to get by not knowing the language there. We also mentioned how there are so many countries that it's common for people to just know english. He said he had planned on doing a sailing trip in Thailand with his sister and brother-in-law, but it got cancelled because his sister had a kid.

In the venings I will spend time getting personal chores done and finding time to relax and do things that I enjoy doing. I probably won't have as much free time this week as I usually do.",It overall went very well. We had a common interest of traveling and have both travelled quite a bit so we had a lot to talk about and it seemed pretty easy for both of us to come up with things to say. We also seemed to generally agree on our overall view of traveling so there weren't moments of disagreement or any negative emotions.,"The beginning was a little ibt hard to get going. It wasn't bad, it just took us a bit of time to find a topic we were both able to talk a lot about, so we went around to a couple of different topics. There were times where it seemed like he either had no idea what to say, or he just wasn't interested at all in the conversation and was just watching the time, so I felt pressured to come up with something to keep the conversation going. I usually got this feeling when the conversation lulled and he would glance down but not say anything else or make any facial expression.",4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,7.0,8.0,4.0,50.0,50.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,2.0,5.0,,2.0,,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,female,4.0,white,bachelors_degree,1.0,,8.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,24.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.0,6.0,,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.6666666666666667,4.0,4.333333333333333,2.6666666666666665,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.333333333333333,2.0,4.0,,

She was good at asking questions if there was a lull in the conversation which was nice. She had some interesting things going on in her life which made it easy for me to find things to ask her about too.,It can be hard to find things to talk about with a complete stranger so we started with some basic questions about what we did for work and details like that.
