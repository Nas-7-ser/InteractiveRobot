I'm trying to be extra hygienic with my teeth lately because I have surgery to remove my wisdom teeth next week so I'm flossing and brushing after every meal instead of just twice a day. Besides all that I'm just trying to keep myself occupied and mentally stimulated in a healthy way with hobbies instead of social media or mindless consumption of netflix.","I think we were both really good about keeping the conversation flowing naturally. There was a good give and take, we both asked questions and answered them thoughtfully and tried to keep the conversation flowing the whole time. We happened to be in the same city currently so there was a lot we could pretty much effortlessly  talk about without having much awkward silence.","I am super shy, and asking probing questions to a stranger doesn't come naturally to me. My partner was much better than I was about asking questions to keep the conversation going, I feel like I could have done much better about that.
