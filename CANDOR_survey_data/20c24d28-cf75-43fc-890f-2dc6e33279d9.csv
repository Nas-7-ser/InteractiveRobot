I hope that I can shake my emotional slump soon and get my life back on track.,"We both were people interested in learning about the stranger on the other end. i was curious about what they did and where they lived. It was nice learning about another person's life. We both had a good sense about balance in the conversation, and both of us got to learn about the other evenly.","There were no technical issues to speak of. The only issue was what I usually see in these video call where it's too easy to talk over another person. I find that for whatever reason, it is much too easy for the two participants to cut each other off.
