I'm going to have to tough it out and be strong and hopefully be able to get over what is coming with my coworker. My boss is going to have to rely on me way more. ,"She had questions ready to go and was easily able to follow up and ask clarifying questions. She was very friendly and open, and extremely easy to talk to. I felt very comfortable being open and telling her about my life. We had in common that we both really liked costumes. ",I had a call from my boss just as the conversation was starting so I had to make her wait while I finished that call which was uncomfortable. Also I am not as good at asking questions so the conversation was very heavily directed towards me talking about my life and my thoughts where I didn't get to ask many things about her and her life. ,5.0,5.0,9.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,8.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,9.0,2.0,6.0,9.0,7.0,50.0,50.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,9.0,2.0,2.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,,1.0,1.0,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,6.0,8.0,6.0,9.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,male,4.0,white,masters_degree,1.0,,9.0,6.0,2.0,,False,,,32.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,5.25,7.0,1.3333333333333333,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.3333333333333333,4.0,2.3333333333333335,1.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.3333333333333335,1.0,5.0,,

I will also watch a bunch of shows and hug my baby yoda once it gets here. I will also call friends. Once I have finished everything, I will be able to rest.",What worked well in the conversation was our interests. We both liked costumes. We both had an interest in fencing and a background of music. I was able to ask him questions about a lot and he was able to answer them. We also both lived in New Jersey so that was cool!,We did not have a great deal in common. The beginning of the conversation was rocky and it felt a bit cold. There did not seem to be that much to talk about and pauses would be uncomfortable.
