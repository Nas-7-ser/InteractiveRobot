I feel that the differences are all political and my partner also agreed with that thought ,9.0,9.0,9.0,The talk was going strong at the end but the twenty five mark was up.....we could have talked longer but we have the same mind set which is making money with side projects doing a good job while being efficient with the time it takes ,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,7.0,7.0,9.0,92.0,11.0,82.0,85.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,1.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,9.0,8.0,7.0,My days off are over so it is back to work I go....I see it getting better and better....the weather in Florida is getting cooler now so that makes things better. I do wish though my weekend hours were not so long though....that would always make things better I think,The conversation worked well for one thing we both showed up so that makes both people happy because of the pay wwe will get. There was a good talk about how to go about making money with surveys which is a big thing I try to steer the conversation to in the start-up ,There was no problems with this conversation that I notice....there is always that middle part that can be a dry spot.....but this one work well.....I feel I am a funny person so I am able to keep the spirits up with the talk that makes things go well for this talk,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,50.0,50.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,7.0,7.0,9.0,9.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,2.0,,4.0,22.0,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,male,3.0,white,associate_degree,1.0,,8.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,55.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.5,6.0,,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,2.0,3.6666666666666665,,

We spent a lot of time talking about amazon turk and discussing our experiences on that platform. he told me about some of the jobs he had done on amazon turk and i told him about some things i did not like about that platform.,7.0,6.0,7.0,at the end of the conversation we talked a little bit about covid and also about his job at seaworld and how things there had been impacted by covid. we also talked about the wildfires in california and he also asked me about what it is like to be in an earthquake as that is something he had never experienced before and was curious to learn about,5.0,4.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,59.0,2.0,25.0,16.0,3.0,3.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,7.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,3.0,2.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,9.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,7.0,9.0,The rest of the week will continue to be jam packed with both a combination of work tasks but also some family stuff that we have to take care of. The kids have some things going on right now that they need assistance with and we are really focused on that as a family. ,I think that the fact that we both had done work on other survey platforms presented an easy conversation topic to get into so that was helpful as far as having something to discuss right away. Also the fact that he worked an interesting job at a place like seaworld made for some good conversation topics. ,"I think this conversation just felt a little more stiff. It didn't seem like he wanted to have a natural conversation and get to know me, but moreso just wanted to get through the conversation and fill the time any way he could. I say that because of the fact that he did spend a lot of time asking about survey platforms and the like. He was also not the warmest/friendliest guy.
