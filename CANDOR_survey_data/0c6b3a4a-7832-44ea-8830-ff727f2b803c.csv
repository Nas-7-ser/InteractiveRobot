I still need to finish a lot for my classes (I teach) and do a lot around the house so that I can be gone for an extended period of time. I hope to get everything done without too much added stress.,Our conversation really flowed naturally from the beginning. We didn't have any awkward silences that we had to fill. One or both of us always had something to talk about or ask the other person about. We had things in common so it was pretty easy to find things to talk about.,The hardest thing is that we both started talking at the same time pretty often. We did it more than happens in most conversations that I had. It was hard to know if I should continue talking or let him talk. So I tried to vary it where sometimes I kept talking and sometimes I told him to go ahead with what he wanted to say.,5.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,60.0,40.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,9.0,9.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,,2.0,,4.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,female,6.0,mixed,masters_degree,1.0,,6.0,6.0,2.0,,False,,,44.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.375,5.666666666666667,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,4.333333333333333,4.0,2.6666666666666665,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,,
