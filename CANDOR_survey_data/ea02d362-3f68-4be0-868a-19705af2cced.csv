Tomorrow I will spend some time in the pool drinking margaritas and cleaning the bottom of the pool. Will probably do some yard work as well, and continue reading my current book (Vodka) while watching the final season of The Leftovers.",The video and audio were both very clear. We eventually found a topic that interested both of us--video games. So we were able to talk about the various video games we liked and why we liked them. Also had fun discussing how we found Prolific and other testing sites online. ,"I felt like I was carrying the vast majority of the conversation. Especially for the first ten minutes or so, my questions were met with one word answers and he was not responding with any questions of his own. He was also a bit pushy at times trying to find out personal details I was not comfortable sharing and would not be comfortable sharing with anyone on first meeting them (the name of the school I was attending, for example).",2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,8.0,2.0,3.0,7.0,3.0,5.0,7.0,4.0,1.0,80.0,20.0,2.0,2.0,7.0,5.0,2.0,8.0,6.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,,,4.0,0.0,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,7.0,4.0,6.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,male,1.0,white,masters_degree,1.0,,9.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,34.0,5.0,,20.0,40.0,40.0,0.0,0.0,40.0,0.0,60.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.5,1.6666666666666667,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.3333333333333333,4.333333333333333,1.6666666666666667,4.333333333333333,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.3333333333333335,1.0,romantic_partner,phone_call

I also plan to study a little for the upcoming school year and to work out more since quarantine has made me somewhat lazy and made me gain a few pounds.,I think something that worked well with the conversation was the flow of it and my partner really knew how to hold one. We also had something in common in the form of video games and we could talk about current events such as the release of the long-awaited PS5 console. It did not feel like 25 minutes for me personally,I think there were no technological factors that negatively impacted the quality of this call. I can't think of anything that did not work well whatsoever. Only thing I can think of was that maybe I should've been more active in holding the conversation. It felt as if he was doing most of the initiating but I was fine with that.,5.0,5.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,8.0,8.0,9.0,45.0,55.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,8.0,8.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,2.0,,4.0,25.0,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,male,3.0,asian,some_college,1.0,,9.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,20.0,4.0,,50.0,0.0,5.0,45.0,0.0,90.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,0.0,3.0,6.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,5.125,6.0,2.3333333333333335,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.3333333333333335,4.0,3.0,4.333333333333333,2.6666666666666665,4.333333333333333,4.333333333333333,3.3333333333333335,2.3333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,family,in_person
