Hikes in the morning followed by work during the day   Reaching out to friends and family when I can by phone and video chats.   I will watch a series on Netflix or BBC with my wife after dinner at around 7 pm.  We may have another zoom cocktail party on the weekend.  ,What worked well about the conversation was asking questions about what the other person did and showing interest.  Once I know what was important or most of interest I would ask follow up questions on the topic like school in our case.  I also tried to make the person feel at ease. ,What didn’t work well during the conversation occurred when I asked where the other person was.  I did not need to know specifically but I just asked to get the ball rolling.  Silence also does create an awkward feeling.  I tried to not let that go too long.  It probably didn’t help that I was a few minutes late.  ,9.0,7.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,7.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,3.0,50.0,50.0,6.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,8.0,8.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,15.0,,,4.0,20.0,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,male,4.0,white,bachelors_degree,1.0,,7.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,57.0,4.0,,0.0,50.0,50.0,0.0,0.0,50.0,10.0,40.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,5.375,6.0,1.3333333333333333,1.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,4.333333333333333,3.6666666666666665,2.0,4.0,2.3333333333333335,4.333333333333333,3.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,4.0,romantic_partner,in_person

While I do not think it will be eventful at all, I do think that it will be more calming for me and that I will have more focus on the tasks that I would like to get done.","Both of us asked a lot of questions, were open to one another's opinions, and were curious about one another and our lives. I think these things make for a good conversation with someone that you've never met before. Not to mention, once we entered the call, we eased our emotions so that we were calm and could think of conversation topics.","At times, I found that I, myself, was a bit nervous and low energy. Also, my partner was a bit unsure about directions of the experiment. We also kept bringing up the same topics over and over again, which got quite repetitive.
