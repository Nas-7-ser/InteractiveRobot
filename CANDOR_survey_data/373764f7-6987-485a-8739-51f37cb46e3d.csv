She also told me a bit about her work and how she's working from home. She also told me about how she signed her mom up for the same phone plan as her.,5.0,5.0,5.0,"She told me about her boyfriend and how they met at the same training at her work. When they first met, he was engaged, but they got together after his engagement ended. We also talked about how she lived in LA for two years after college, and stayed in a friends place while working for herself. She also told me about how she's in graduate school for business. She told me about what her week looks like in terms of work and school.",6.0,6.0,5.0,We talked about how COVID-19 has impacted our work and activities. She shared that she's looking forward to seeing her coworkers for a training on Monday. She said she's been very careful because she lives with her mom and doesn't want to get her sick. ,5.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,81.0,4.0,66.0,20.0,4.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,2.0,6.0,5.0,7.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,7.0,6.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,7.0,5.0,9.0,9.0,8.0,6.0,I'm pretty stressed because I have a lot of school work and exams coming up. I am excited for Monday though because I'm going with a friend to pick up some plants from Home Depot. I'll be pretty busy next weekend with events for my sorority. I'm excited because I'll get to see one of my roommates on Wednesday because she's coming back from a trip. ,"Jane was very kind and open. She elaborated on her points and shared a great deal of information. I think we got along pretty well and were able to relate to different things, even though we're in different stages of life. Furthermore, I think we found one another's presence pleasant.","Maybe one issue with the conversation would just be the fact that we're in different phases of life. She's working full time while studying for her graduate degree, while I'm a full time undergraduate student. I think maybe another reason our conversation was lacking is because we come from different backgrounds, as she's from Kentucky and stayed there for university while I grew up in Spain and moved to America for university.
