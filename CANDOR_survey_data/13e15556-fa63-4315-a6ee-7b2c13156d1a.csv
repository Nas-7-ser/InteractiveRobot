She said it was difficult and I related to that how it is hard for kids with the COVID-19 pandemic. The sense of isolation is difficult.,4.0,6.0,8.0,"We talked more about how she feels that work/life balance is hard to manage with working on the school newspaper, and I talked about how since people are home more due to COVID-19 some people expect you to be available at all times. That is difficult and makes it hard to manage work-life balance.",4.0,6.0,9.0,We talked about how to find some positives in things and how COVID-19 will not last forever.

I will also walk along the canal with my kids, which will be a nice break.",I think we both had similar views on COVID. We both believed in the importance of wearing masks and socially distancing. I think we could relate to each other. We were both kind to each other. We did not interrupt one another. We did not have trouble coming up with topics.,"Sometimes there were short awkward silences. We are at different life stages (I am much older than she is), so it was a little hard to relate to one another sometimes.
