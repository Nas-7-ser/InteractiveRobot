My partner was telling me about the show called The Pickers and how they pay a fair price for items they buy, and then we touched briefly on Pawn Stars and how they were more miserly.

Then I asked what is his current favorite show and we talked about The Walking Dead and I talked about Supernatural.",8.0,7.0,8.0,Nick pretty much handled the majority of the end of our conversation. He told a story of what happened to him at work yesterday and how he dealt with the situation and how he felt.

On Sunday I will work the sound board at church and I may do a little grocery shopping. I will work a little bit on my German homework.","Nick was friendly and had done conversations like this before, so it was easy to talk with him. He kept the conversation going and was mindful of the time we spent talking. I was genuinely curious about the things he was interested in and so that made the conversation continue. I felt we only had one very small moment of conversation breakdown, maybe 5-10 seconds, and then we were able to think of more to discuss.",Talking about COVID was a little stressful to me because it's kind of like talking about politics or religion with someone you don't know. It was a bit uncomfortable but I think we made it through that part of the conversation without having a total disagreement and we were able to move on to other topics.,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,8.0,8.0,7.0,40.0,60.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,9.0,9.0,4.0,2.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,2.0,,4.0,25.0,,,2.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,female,4.0,white,associate_degree,7.0,"Student, not working",8.0,10.0,2.0,,False,,,50.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.375,6.0,,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.6666666666666665,5.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,3.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,1.6666666666666667,2.6666666666666665,,
