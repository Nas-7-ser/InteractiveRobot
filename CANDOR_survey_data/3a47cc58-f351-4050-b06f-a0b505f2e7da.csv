",We were able to overcome the initial 'not sure what to talk about' rather quickly and came around to approximately two main conversation topics (coronavirus and my research study). It seemed we took equal responsibility for keeping the conversation going. There were rarely any lulls. It felt mostly natural. We were able to speak for twenty five minutes while just having met. ,"Well, I think the most awkward thing about the conversation was attempting to end it. It felt odd to have a conversation going while on a timer, with the intent to keep it for a certain amount of time, where you build a degree of rapport and get into a certain rhythm, but then also want to stop at a precise time in order to respect the other person's time and get on with your day. It made it weird to remember we were both doing this for a study, and likely for money, not out of a true filial attachment or anything.
