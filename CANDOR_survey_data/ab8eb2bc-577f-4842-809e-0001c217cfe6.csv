My mom just got a huge promotion so we will celebrate this weekend with a cake and a special dinner. I will get to seem my friend Ben who I haven't seen in a long time and I'm also so excited about that.,I immediately felt comfortable in the conversation because it seemed like my conversation partner was queer. This helped me open up with them and feel like I could be myself with them. They were also just a really easy to talk to person which made the conversation go so well.,"Pretty much nothing went wrong during the conversation I just had. If I had to identify one issue, though, it would be long conversation turns. During these turns, we didn't do a great job of providing each other verbal or visual feedback. Better turn taking behavior could have improved the quality of our conversation.",5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,9.0,9.0,5.0,50.0,50.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,7.0,7.0,9.0,9.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,,1.0,3.0,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,9.0,7.0,7.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,female,6.0,white,some_college,1.0,,7.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,21.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6.25,7.0,,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.333333333333333,4.666666666666667,3.6666666666666665,2.0,4.333333333333333,4.666666666666667,5.0,4.333333333333333,1.6666666666666667,4.666666666666667,,

My brother is in town, who I haven't seen in 6 months so I'm going to spend a lot of time with him. I've been looking forward to his visit for a while because he and I just get along really well and I don't get to see very many people these days so especially getting to spend time with someone who I get along with so well is a nice change of pace. ","My partner and I were very close to the same age, they were the youngest person I've talked to which I think played  a large role in how much we related to one another. We sort of had a shared  culture by way of being the same age and going through the same life style. We also click on our passion for culture and travel and shared some great stories. I think us both starting the call in a very good mood helped as well. ","There were just a few moments where we didn't know what to talk about next. Obviously since we had never met, we didn't really know each others interests or what their life was like so its hard to scope out potential topics there. The other folks I have talked to have all been older and it was easy to ask them about like their families and they'd have lots to talk about there. I couldn't really assume that here so my like go -to questions weren't on the table. Plus I was enjoying the conversation so much and liked my partner so much that I didn't want to waste our time on small talk or boring topics, I felt like I needed to pick a good topic so I wasn't always as quick to fill the gaps in conversation.
