I think it will be good. Anything beats this past week. I have a hearing due in a few days so I am stressed and nervous about that. I am very tired because I had a huge lesson plan due today.,I think we were in the same age bracket which made it easier to talk to her. I think we had similar interests like food and video games so it was good to talk about that. I think I lead most of the conversation which is ok I didn't mind.,I would have liked to know her political views because I didn't want to say anything controversial that she didn't like so I tried to mostly stay away from politics. I also would have liked to know her age and background but that feels weird to ask a person online.

We also discussed eating and some food we each enjoy. They really like pizza pringles. I got a laugh out of them drinking water out of a vase, too. They are high risk for COVID so discussed how they have been social distancing. ",7.0,7.0,9.0,"We discussed New York state a lot since that is where they live. I told them I'm interested in vacationing there, so they talked a bit about what is in the state and several festivities held in the state.

I will be spending a lot of time outdoors enjoying nature, or relaxing in my house watching TV to wrap up a rather busy and stressful week. I plan to spend a lot of time with my dogs, eat junk food, and get a little work done here and there.","I believe we had quite a bit in common, which helped keep the conversation rolling. It didn't feel like 30 minutes had passed, which tells me we got along pretty well! If there was a bit of a pause, one of us filled it almost immediately to keep things going.","I felt like my conversation partner wanted to take the lead a lot, which is ok, but it felt like when I spoke they wanted to be talking rather than listening. That may have just been them wanting to fill the space, or anxiety (I can talk more when I get anxious, too), but it did feel a little like they didn't care about the conversation.",5.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,7.0,4.0,3.0,7.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,8.0,6.0,9.0,30.0,70.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,3.0,5.0,8.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,6.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,20.0,,,4.0,10.0,,,3.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,6.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,female,3.0,white,bachelors_degree,1.0,,8.0,6.0,2.0,,False,,,29.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.75,4.666666666666667,,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.3333333333333333,4.333333333333333,3.3333333333333335,4.666666666666667,3.6666666666666665,2.6666666666666665,2.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,4.666666666666667,,
