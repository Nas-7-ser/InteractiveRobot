It's been pretty busy so far, but I am trying to stay positive. I have quite a few plans this coming weekend that I'm really looking forward to also. I will be spending a lot of time with family and friends.",The conversation just kept going from start to finish with no pauses or weird moments. We had a lot to talk about and had a lot of similarities with regards to our work environments and what we do for a living. I enjoyed the conversation very much. I could see myself being friends with someone like him. ,"There is honestly nothing that I can think of. Our conversation went well, and we spoke as if we had known each other for a very long time. I felt that we would be friends in real life and would make great coworkers if we ever had to work together.

I very much enjoy learning more about the technology I either operating or strategize my team to operate. I also want to spend more time playing outside with my family before it gets too chilly to play outside again! ,Talking about our professional lives was very important. I think that lended well to the conversation. I felt like I had a lot in common with her professionally as a white collared worker. I enjoyed listening to how the team was a bit overworked and I felt that shared view of my team as well so I connected quickly. ,"I think the beginning of the conversation got off to a slower start. I noticed that many of her answers were short in the very beginning of the conversation. However, after about 3-4 minutes, she seemed to be much more open and natural with her answers and her conversation. I noticed she changed rooms and she felt much more comfortable after changing rooms it seemed.
