I think this conversation has made me more hopeful and optimistic about my goals and tasks for the week. I've been pretty stressed out recently, but I feel like being able to talk to someone casually about life feels refreshing. ","There were no technical issues this time, so that really helped. In the conversation I feel like my partner was really good at finding topics to talk about, and that kept up a good flow. Additionally, it seemed like we were both in a good mood, so I think that played a role in the conversation starting off on a good note. ","I think because we did not know each other that well, and were okay that, we purposely kept things vague and talked about ""how was the weather"" types of topics that you could easily talk about with anyone you've first met.
