I have some work to do that I am especially passionate about completing so that will be a fun hurdle to pass. I will also have some programming homework I'll have to do so I am going to be pretty busy for this week but it will probably end in a very comfortable manner.,"We both were able to speak without really pausing to hear what the other was saying. We almost never interrupted each other and it was a very natural feeling conversation. We had some things in common, but not too much. I think this made the talk between us more interesting.",Sometimes both of us would talk for maybe a little too long. There were also times when there was some dead space in our conversations but not too much. Most of the time we would spend on one topic and I think we could have talked more about others if we didn't talk for so long.,6.0,7.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,7.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,6.0,38.0,62.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,7.0,7.0,9.0,9.0,2.0,2.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,25.0,,,5.0,,1.0,1.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,7.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,male,3.0,black_or_african_american,some_college,2.0,,8.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,21.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,3.0,3.0,5.75,7.0,2.6666666666666665,2.3333333333333335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.6666666666666665,4.333333333333333,3.6666666666666665,2.6666666666666665,4.0,4.666666666666667,5.0,5.0,1.3333333333333333,4.0,,

I had woken up with some neck pain and felt tired, but then I thought, you know, I will get through this.  Everyone has challenges, and I am strong and resilient.   I will manage through pain and use some heat to help it feel better.",I think we each tried to get to know each other by asking open ended questions.  It was good to talk about what hobbies or things we have tried during covid-19 where we tried to talk about more positive things as opposed to covid-19 itself which is more negative and stressful. ,Sometimes it felt like we did not know how to connect with each other because we are at different life stages.
