She was very tech-savvy, however, and was able to quickly resolve the problem. We started by talking about what we're planning to do today (what type of work). ",8.0,8.0,8.0,"During the middle of the conversation, we talked about places we have lived and what liked and didn't like about them (weather, culture, etc..)

In the evenings, I'm planning to finish a collection of surface-pattern designs I've been working on as part of an online challenge.","The conversation flowed smoothly throughout most of the 25 minutes. Unlike most of my previous chats, we were not talking over one another, and that was nice. My partner was extremely intelligent and friendly, and I really enjoyed listening to her. She was also a good listener, and easy to talk to.","Unfortunately, I don't think my partner found me as interesting as I found her. Although she was extremely kind and personable, I felt much less intelligent than her, and sort of at a loss for what to talk about that she might find interesting. I found myself more than once doing the ""nervous talk,"" where I was just saying anything that came to mind to compensate for my own discomfort.

I think, though it'll be busy, I'll have a good week. I may even complete one or two of my long-term goals this week, which is extremely exciting.","I think that each of us took the opportunity to talk more about ourselves more than we'd usually do so in other contexts. And I was definitely interested in what she had to say, because she's not a boring person. We each had an opinion about what the other had to say, so it seemed to flow pretty well with no silences.","I guess we didn't have a lot in common, so both of us had to make more of an effort to keep the conversation going.
