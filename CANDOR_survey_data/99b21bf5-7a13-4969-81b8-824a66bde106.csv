I will wake up late in the afternoon after sleeping late, get out of bed and put off finding something to eat throughout the day before staying up way past midnight.",I think what worked well in our conversation was that we were very easily able to find conversation points that were very in-depth from beginning to end. There were very few if any at all lulls in the conversation as our transitions from one topic to another were unnoticeable and not awkward at all.,"If I had to hold a very critical eye to the conversation that we had, I would say that what didn't work about our conversation was the fact that at some points we would interrupt each other accidentally.

Our governor has announced new lockdown restrictions so what freedom we did have is going away.  I worry how my kids will react to this stricter lockdown. I also have some stressful work duties to take care of this week. Iâ€™m crossing my fingers that all will go well and the end of the week will see some improvements. 
",My partner was easy to talk to. We had a few things in common to keep the conversation going. He was responsive to questions and gave long answers so their were not to many chances for awkward silences. We also had a good flow of conversation with not many interruptions between each other.,We had a pretty big age difference so it was a little difficult to find common ground. The age difference caused the conversation to be kept pretty superficial and stay away from sensitive topics around politics and personal opinions. My partner also seemed to be struggling a little with current conditions as far as unemployment and not going to school so I felt I needed to keep it light and friendly. ,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,7.0,3.0,7.0,7.0,3.0,60.0,40.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,7.0,8.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,,2.0,,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,8.0,6.0,8.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,male,3.0,white,masters_degree,1.0,,8.0,6.0,2.0,,False,,,42.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.125,4.666666666666667,,1.6666666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,4.0,3.6666666666666665,1.3333333333333333,4.0,2.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,2.6666666666666665,4.0,3.0,,
