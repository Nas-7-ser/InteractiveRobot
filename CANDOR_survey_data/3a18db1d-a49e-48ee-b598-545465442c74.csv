She talked about her career aspirations, I talked about my hobby of genealogy. We talked about how covid affected both of us. We talked about our families. We were interested in each other.","It all went so well and the time flew by. We could have kept talking. She was super friendly, warm, interesting. Sometimes we talked over each other. We were both a bit nervous at first.

I have some work commitments and am catching up with an old coworker and friend who I haven't seen in a long time, which I'm looking forward to. Hopefully, I am also able to mend a relationship in my life that was broken recently so that I can reconnect with a person I care about. I feel a low level of background anxiety as I await to hear admission notifications from some schools that I have applied for, but I feel confident and prepared to accept those outcomes - just somewhat impatient to receive the news.","Both my partner and I took turns asking questions to keep the natural flow of the conversation going. Not one person dominated the conversation. We first found common ground in our situations (staying at home due to COVID), then talked a bit about pets (my interest), and then transitioned to her interests (genealogy). We were both able to relate to one another with every topic. She also seemed very friendly and engaging. ","Nothing seemed particularly dysfunctional in our conversation. At first, I was a little apprehensive seeing that we were in different age demographics and thought that this might hinder the smoothness of our conversation; however, we connected well nonetheless. Our first couple of topics (quarantine and pets) were a little generic and therefore seemed like trivial small talk, which in turn made me feel a tiny bit awkward, but in general, I don't think we had any issues or problematic interactions in our conversation.
