I have very little homework assigned so I will have a lot of free time to do fun things with my family. What homework I do have will be in subjects that I am interested in. I'm also looking forward to spending time with some friends.,I think my conversation partner was very enthusiastic. I immediately felt that he was happy to talk to me and hear what I had to say. He seemed interested in learning about my life and telling me about his interests. We also did a good job taking turns talking and resolving any audio issues.,A major problem was that my conversation partner was not very bright. He didn't seem to know the basic geography of America. He thought that Maryland was a country and that Florida was on the west cost. This made telling him basic things like where I live difficult because he didn't understand the layout of the world.,9.0,9.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,9.0,3.0,4.0,7.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,45.0,55.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,7.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,7.0,,,5.0,,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,3.0,7.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,female,6.0,white,some_college,1.0,,7.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,21.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.25,3.6666666666666665,,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,4.666666666666667,3.3333333333333335,2.0,4.333333333333333,3.3333333333333335,4.333333333333333,1.3333333333333333,4.0,1.6666666666666667,,

But also slow at the same time because things are slowing down before thanksgiving. It really depends on the requests and deadlines set, which may be pushed till after thanksgiving but either way my work has to get done, so delaying doesn't really change much. Spreading it out and not rushing definitely helps with the quality.","We were both young, open minded. Both enjoyed Jane the Virgin. The conversation topics were really fun and made me laugh. I was educated and learned new things I didn't know. Ellie was very kind and open to discussing whatever was on our minds. Nothing felt forced or unnatural. We shared and discussed pretty equally in conversation.","Honestly nothing bad to say about Ellie. There were a few moments of pauses and stops, but I feel like they were natural and still flowed with the conversation. I drank a smoothie which kind of interrupted a little bit and put the conversation at a small awkward pause, but it still rolled through smoothly.",4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,55.0,45.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,7.0,6.0,5.0,7.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,2.0,,4.0,15.0,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,8.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,male,3.0,asian,bachelors_degree,1.0,,8.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,24.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.0,5.0,,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.6666666666666665,4.0,3.6666666666666665,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.6666666666666665,2.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,4.0,,
