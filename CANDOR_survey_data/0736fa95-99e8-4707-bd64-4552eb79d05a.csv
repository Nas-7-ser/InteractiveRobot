I asked her about her visit to NY in the past and she told me about her future plans. Learning about how the other person lives works well. Also, Covid is a topic on many people's minds.

There were a couple of things I didn't know how to keep moving so I tried changing the subject so another super general subject to at least keep a flow going. ","It was just super hard to guage if she wanted to keep talking about something or not. She was hard to read and we didn't have a ton in common, so it was painful at times to frantically grasp for topics or questions.
