He lived in western New York and I live in California and that then led us to discuss snowfall in months as late as May and I shared how I use to live in Michigan and that it snowed in May when we lived there.",7.0,5.0,8.0,We talked about the fires that occurred in California.  I shared how we had experienced bad air in California and that we are now very familiar with the Air Quality Index.   I also shared a picture that I took in August when the sky had an orange glow all day due to the ash and smoke.,6.0,4.0,9.0,We talked about the impacts of COVID-19 and why some people refuse to believe in the risks of COVID.  I shared a recent newspaper story about some of the people who became very ill from attending the Sturgis Motorcycle rally in South Dakota.   We then talked about people who survive COVID but have long term health implications due to the virus.,6.0,4.0,7.0,7.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,60.0,4.0,35.0,35.0,3.0,4.0,7.0,7.0,6.0,2.0,8.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,7.0,9.0,8.0,7.0,8.0,7.0,9.0,8.0,7.0,6.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,4.0,8.0,8.0,9.0,7.0,8.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,6.0,7.0,I see the rest of my week being busy as I have several work and non-work projects happening simultaneously.   The work projects will keep me busy for the next several days.   The non-work projects will peak on Wednesday and should then start to decrease as I get closer to the weekend.  I am looking forward to the end of this week.,"I think that my conversation partner, about halfway through the conversation, made a humorous remark that I believed in both climate change and the virus.  He then went on to explain that where he lives in western New York, it is very rural and a lot of the people in his community refuse to believe that either the virus is fully real or that climate change is occurring - so his admission of that helped us to find common ground in the conversation and I felt more trusting of him for the remainder of the conversation.","I think that what didn't work well is that we never officially introduced ourselves at the beginning of the conversation.  Thus, I never knew his name or if he had a family and he never knew my name or if I had a family.  That left me feeling somewhat ""empty"" at the end of the call as I would have liked to have known his name and more about his background.",3.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,55.0,45.0,6.0,4.0,3.0,6.0,4.0,9.0,8.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,7.0,6.0,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,,2.0,,4.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,8.0,5.0,6.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,male,4.0,white,masters_degree,1.0,,7.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,54.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.5,6.0,,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.6666666666666665,4.0,4.666666666666667,2.6666666666666665,4.0,2.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,3.0,2.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,,

He talked about all the sunshine they get and I talked about the snow. He also mentioned how he went to college in MI so he had experience dealing with snow. ",5.0,3.0,4.0,"Toward the middle of the conversation, we talked a little about the wildfires. We also talked about the phenomenon of wearing masks and how some people in his area were already wearing masks due to the concentration of smoke in the area.",5.0,4.0,6.0,"Toward the end of the conversation, we talked more broadly about the mindsets of people, broadly speaking. We talked about the important contributions of science throughout history and how some people choose to politicize certain aspects of science. I mentioned how people can recognize science when it comes to tangible things, but have trouble extrapolating this to more abstract ideas like COVID-19 and climate change.",4.0,3.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,60.0,2.0,30.0,55.0,4.0,3.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,2.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,"Today was a day off from work for me, so I have the rest of the week ahead to focus on a couple of projects I am juggling at work. I have a few meetings throughout the week which are very important for the advancement projects. Furthermore, at the end of the week, I have to drive my spouse and children some distance so they can see my spouse's side of the family. I have a lot of responsibilities this week.",What worked well is the fact that my conversation partner was from the opposite side of the U.S. than myself. We could exchange our perspectives on living in the areas we do. It also helped that we had a shared perspective on some big-issue topics such as COVID-19 and climate change. The fact we saw eye-to-eye on those issues contributed to how well we get along.,"What didn't work so well from my perspective is the fact that my conversation partner was more verbose than myself. During one monologue, he would cover several different topics. As he spoke, I had several ideas that I wanted to convey but I could not seem to find the right time to jump in. When I finally could, the topic I wanted to speak about had already passed. I feel the conversation would have had better mutual flow if he spoke in shorter spurts.",5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,8.0,3.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,8.0,7.0,7.0,20.0,80.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,20.0,,,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,male,4.0,white,bachelors_degree,1.0,,9.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,28.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.125,5.333333333333333,,1.6666666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,3.0,3.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,4.0,2.3333333333333335,4.333333333333333,,
