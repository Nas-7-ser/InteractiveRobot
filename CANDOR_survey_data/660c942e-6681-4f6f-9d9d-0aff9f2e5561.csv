My partner almost right away recognized my German accent.,7.0,7.0,6.0,My chat partner asked me about my experience with becoming a US citizen. We also talked about moving from one state to another and how hard it can sometimes be to get a new drivers license.,7.0,7.0,7.0,"We talked a lot about the imperial and metric system. I mentioned my problems with learning the imperial system coming from the metric system. My chat partner also had some experience with someone from Germany, and described the difficulties of translating a German cook book.",6.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,70.0,4.0,60.0,50.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,1.0,7.0,8.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,7.0,8.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,7.0,8.0,9.0,8.0,9.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,6.0,I am going to spend the rest of the week mostly working. I get up early in the morning and start working almost right away after having breakfast. I am going to do some house chores in the late morning and then take a lunch break before getting back to work. In the evening I am going to have dinner with my wife and relax most likely watching some TV.,"The conversation started quickly and almost immediately we had something in common to talk about. So it was very easy to get into the conversation. We have discovered some things we have in common, that made it even easier. I did not have to worry about not having something to contribute to the conversation.",Overall I can't say much negative things about the conversation. My chat partner was perhaps a little more dominant in the conversation and basically dictated the topics we were talking about. Sometimes she talked a little bit too long. I probably would have liked to change topics more often than we actually did.,5.0,6.0,6.0,3.0,4.0,7.0,3.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,8.0,7.0,7.0,35.0,65.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,6.0,7.0,8.0,7.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,2.0,5.0,,1.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,male,4.0,white,some_college,1.0,,6.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,53.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.25,6.0,,1.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.3333333333333333,4.666666666666667,4.0,1.6666666666666667,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.6666666666666665,3.0,3.0,,

I still have one vacation day left before I have to go back to work on the weekend. I feel like I will be able to relax for the next couple of days, and be ready to go back to work when the time comes. Hopefully work won’t be too busy on the weekend, and I can enjoy the two days off following that without being too tired. ","There was easy back-and-forth in the conversation. We talked about a variety of topics, with very few awkward lags in the conversation. We learned interesting things about each others experiences, which are very different. We had a fair amount of each of us talking, and listening. Given our very different life experiences, it was easy to ask questions that lead to a lot of conversation. ","Overall, things worked well. There were a few moments of overlapping conversation, but we were able to take turns easily and fix that. Conversation was a little stilted at the very beginning, but after that it took off pretty smoothly.   I can’t think of too many things that went very badly.
