I get to grill outside which I love. I'll probably be a little stressed since I have to write a final exam on Sunday but over all it should be and okay weekend.",My partner was really good at listening and keeping up with what I was saying. We had a lot of overlap with our musical interests. We were also able to kind of keep the flow going for quite a while without too much effort. At the twenty minute mark was when I first bothered to look at the time.,Well my partner was good at listening but I felt I was talking too much. I asked them if they had anything they wanted to talk about and they weren't sure. I think they like hearing other people talk which is what I normally do. I struggled to come up with more things but not dominate the conversation.,9.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,5.0,1.0,7.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,4.0,8.0,9.0,3.0,72.0,28.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,7.0,9.0,7.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,4.0,23.0,,,5.0,,1.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,male,2.0,white,masters_degree,1.0,,5.0,6.0,2.0,,False,,,37.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.375,6.333333333333333,,1.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,4.333333333333333,3.6666666666666665,4.666666666666667,2.3333333333333335,4.666666666666667,4.0,2.6666666666666665,4.0,,

While my conversation wasn’t life changing, I got to hear some cool stories that made me smile and laugh, I’ll definitely be thinking about that alpaca farm he told me about a few times and laugh to myself about it. He gave me some recommendations for music that I will most definitely check out and think of him with!","I’m not a huge small talker, I really just like listening to people and hearing their stories. He’s a good storyteller so I think both those elements helped conversation occur. I also put the conversation to music since I think it’s a topic we all can find some sort of common ground or talking point. He was also just a warm person who just had an energy of kindness and likeability, making it easier to talk.","I don’t think anything necessarily. Like I said before I’m not the greatest small talker, so I wish I would have had more to give when he was talking about his jobs, etc., but I didn’t have any stories of my own. Because of that I didn’t feel like I had anything to contribute other than typical nods and “mhmm” when listening.",5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,9.0,9.0,7.0,35.0,65.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,8.0,9.0,9.0,2.0,1.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,,1.0,3.0,4.0,22.0,,,5.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,6.0,3.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,female,3.0,white,bachelors_degree,1.0,,6.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,22.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.625,7.0,,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.6666666666666667,5.0,4.333333333333333,1.6666666666666667,4.666666666666667,4.0,5.0,4.666666666666667,1.0,5.0,,
