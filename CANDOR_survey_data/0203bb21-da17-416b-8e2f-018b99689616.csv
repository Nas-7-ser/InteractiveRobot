The conversation rarely dragged and it definitely felt like we could continue talking had we needed to stay on the line longer.,"Some aspects of our conversation were a bit superficial. I am also maybe not the best in terms of leading the conversation and asking questions, so I probably spoke more and didn't learn quite as much about my partner as she did about me.
