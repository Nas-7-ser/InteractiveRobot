It was frustrating and confusing. I recall that my partner told me about her work, and about how she felt about it. She also told me a bit about herself and I did the same.",5.0,7.0,7.0,"
Towards the middle of the conversation, I talked more about my life and interests. This included talking about my garden, and about my boyfriend.

I imagine I will spend it doing a lot of abuse of substances, spending time on my artwork, and being outside. I imagine I will be relatively stressed out after Wednesday however, as that is the day everyone in the family comes home. I will do my best to have a good week, though. ",The conversation worked very well when my chat partner and I discussed things that we had in common. Leading the conversation by telling stories about my life that we interesting or humorous let my partner imagine and remember things about their own life. I think that really helped the conversation flow. ,"In the conversation, things did not work well when we only talked about work or art. Talking about the pandemic also got old rather quickly, as we were both being polite enough to not say anything political. There is not a lot to talk about the pandemic without being political.
