We were able to talk about the similarities and differences in our geographical location.  We both had interest in the Australian fires.  We then were able to talk about our own personal experiences of wildfire. ,"I think we were both nervous at the beginning.  We weren't sure what we were going to do, as the directions were minimal.  There were not any other negative problems during the conversation.

This weekend I'll spend with my husband and son, playing games and hanging out. The weather for the next week looks good and there's nothing stressful going on in our lives. ","Karen and I were able to talk about where we lived now and previously. We were both familiar with where each other lived and had some nice chatting about weather and natural occurrences. We talked about our children/grandchildren a bit. We had a big discussion about the Australian wildfires. It was, overall, a pleasant chat. ","I should have asked her more directly about her children and grandchildren. I feel badly about not having done so. I think Karen may have wanted to talk a bit about political leanings, but I avoided that because I had the feeling we would not really align politically.
