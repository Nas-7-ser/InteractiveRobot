I have had to correct a lot of payroll errors for my clients, which thankfully is over now. Now all I have to do is some basic admin work and set up a new account. I know that is all about work stuff, but life is pretty uneventful lately. I could talk about all the shows I will be watching!! lol ","I really enjoyed talking to her! She was super friendly has a lot to say and was easy to talk to. I felt very comfortable talking to her about various things like race, politics, COVID, healthcare, and many other things that I would not normally talk about with a stranger!","The video quality was pretty bad in the beginning.

I have a few other meetings and conversations scheduled through the week that I need to be prepared for. After a couple of weeks of being very run-down, both physically and mentally, I am starting to feel a little bit better, so I'm hoping to ramp up into being more focused and productive.","We were both generally equally energetic and outgoing, so the conversation never flagged and it also never felt like either one of us was dominating the conversation. We also fell pretty easily into talking on the same level of being personal/open but not more invasive than the other person was comfortable with. We both had interesting stories to tell, so that was also very enjoyable. And let's be real: David having a dog was an automatic win!","There was one point when we were discussing catcalling and harassment, and while I appreciated the frank insight that he provided (as a man who socializes with a lot of straight men), I also had to calculate how much of my personal opinion I could bring in without inadvertently insulting him or his friends, which took me a little out of the conversation.",4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,50.0,50.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,2.0,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,female,4.0,asian,masters_degree,7.0,Unemployed due to COVID-19,6.5,8.0,2.0,,False,,,35.0,1.0,,0.0,0.0,100.0,0.0,0.0,100.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.625,5.666666666666667,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,4.333333333333333,4.666666666666667,1.3333333333333333,4.0,5.0,3.6666666666666665,5.0,3.3333333333333335,4.0,friends,in_person
