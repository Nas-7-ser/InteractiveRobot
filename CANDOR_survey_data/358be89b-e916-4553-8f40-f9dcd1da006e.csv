I'll be quarantining and working from home for the next week to prepare for possibly visiting my parents for Thanksgiving. I'm worried about visiting my parents, but I'm quarantining and getting tested for COVID a few times before going, so that should help. This week will be busy with work and I'm going to clean my room really well so I have a nice place to be working from at home.",I think the fact that she and I both agreed on a lot of things already really helped. She was nice and we helped each other learn about new books and podcasts that the other might not know about. We also had a similar energy and I really liked talking with her. It was a good and worthwhile conversation that added a bright spot to an already good day.,"I think it was a little awkward at first not knowing what to talk about. She and I both had a moment where we were like ""okay what do we do now?"" and then we figured out what we could talk about. She initiated the conversation by asking if I had any recommendations for books or shows to watch.

She was also really agreeable and easy to talk to.  I felt at ease speaking with her about a variety of subjects, and also that she would be interested. ","I don't think it could have gone a whole lot better.  We got off to a slightly slow start, and it was also a little awkward ending the conversation.  Another, small issue is that we didn't introduce ourselves until (what felt like) over halfway through.  I think that was because it was unclear how much personal info is ok to share in the context of a ""study,"" which is really different from any real-life conversation, where you basically always start by introducing yourselves and sharing some personal details.
