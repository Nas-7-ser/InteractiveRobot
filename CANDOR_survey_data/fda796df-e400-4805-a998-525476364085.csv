I don't think any big stressors from work or outside of work are going to emerge. I look forward to playing more video games on the weekend and reconnecting with friends over calls and video chats, though I'm sad that we probably won't see each other for a couple months still.","We were both engaged in the conversation and happy to learn a little bit more about each other and how we related and thought about current events. We both were able to express our own thoughts, but at the same time listen intently and absorb what the other person was saying, i.e. it wasn't just one person dominating the conversation.","There were sensitive topics that I felt like I wanted to not talk about at the risk of eliciting some strong reactions from the other participant.

I have plans and dinner with my best friend tomorrow night so that will be fun.  We are also going to go on a run which is always a healthy thing to do.  This weekend I have to pack and we already got a lot of stuff done so it shouldn't be too bad. ,The other guy was very easy going and was a good conversationalist.  He was younger than me but not by a whole lot.  We had some things in common so that made the convo easier.  We also had some things different so we had things to talk about and could ask each other questions. ,"He was a bit younger than me and just graduated college, which I have been out of college for more than 10 years.  So we were at different points in our lives which probably made it hard for him to relate to me.  Also, we thought that we were going to have some prompts before the video started to know what to talk about but there were no prompts so we just kind of winged it.
