Over the weekend we have plans to head out to the beach for a little while and just have some down time together.  It should make for a really nice weekend.,I really liked that my partner was easy to talk to.  The conversation went smoothly and we spent a lot of time talking about different topics.  We never really had any quiet times so it was nice to be able to talk to someone that was easy to talk to.  It felt like the time went quickly because the conversation went so smoothly.,I didn't know much about what he did for a career so I wasn't able to ask many questions because I wasn't sure what questions to even ask.  I wish I could have related a little more on that.  But otherwise everything seemed to go very well and we didn't have any other issues.,5.0,5.0,9.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,8.0,8.0,6.0,45.0,55.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,9.0,9.0,4.0,2.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,7.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,female,4.0,white,masters_degree,1.0,,8.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,40.0,7.0,,75.0,0.0,25.0,0.0,0.0,75.0,20.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,5.875,6.666666666666667,1.6666666666666667,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,1.6666666666666667,4.333333333333333,3.3333333333333335,4.666666666666667,4.666666666666667,1.0,5.0,family,in_person

I plan to do some extracurricular and volunteer work during the weekend.","It worked well that we were both similar age and ther ewas not a big difference. 
We were both dealing with COVID virus in our state and our thought on it mathced quite well so we could talk on that thing. I was also able to learn a few things from them about housing market and how COVID have affected it.","The background of the covnersation partner and me was very different.
