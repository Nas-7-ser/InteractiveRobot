It will probably continue on in the same vein as it's been going - lonely, sad, painful, and pointless. I miss him, even though I shouldn't. And I just get the feeling that nobody cares enough to help if I needed it. Plus, I'm sure we'll be going back on lockdown soon so I have that joy to look forward to.",I think what worked well was when I was able to ask questions and she was allowed to speak without me stumbling over her words which was more often than the cause of a delayed or fractured stream. I also felt that she opened up and because a bit more interesting when speaking of her father. ,"The disparity in our ages - while providing some fodder for the conversation and I think the overall pervading theme of our talk - I think was ultimately a barrier that wouldn't have allowed us to explore much more further terrain that we had accomplished in the 25 minutes we did speak. She was a lovely young lady, but by the end of the conversation I was searching for things to talk about.

Aside from talking with my family, I expect to call a few of my friends and keep up-to-date with whatever they are doing. I will also play some video games that I recently bought, as they are a good way to pass the time. For this Fourth of July weekend, I might watch some virtual fireworks shows. However, besides that, I will still remain indoors out of safety concerns. ","I feel like the conversation was able to start strong because of the shared trait of everyone being in the pandemic currently. This led to a natural opening of asking how time passed during the quarantine. One thing that worked well during the conversation was how open and friendly the other party was. Despite the two of us being rather different people (especially age-wise), we were able to use this to our advantage and really get insight talking to someone with different experiences. I feel like this would not have naturally happened in another context (talking for an extended time to a stranger who is so demographically different). ","There were some minor aspects of the conversation that did not work as well. In retrospect, I believe I talked about myself a bit more than I should have, and should have asked him more questions and given him more time to talk. Aside from this imbalance, it was also a bit difficult when transitioning between topics, since we did not know each other well and I was not really sure what would be good to talk about besides small talk. However, despite this, I think after some pauses the conversation started to flow again.
