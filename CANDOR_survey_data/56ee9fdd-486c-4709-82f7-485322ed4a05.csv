They also sounded interested in what I was talking about, and hence were a pleasure to talk to. I really liked knowing about the stages of their lives, given they were elder to me.","I tended to interrupt the person because the video was lagging. That was the major thing. Also, probably that I was disturbed once between the conversation, which might have sounded weird to the conversation partner.

However, although this has been tricky it's also been fun and we feel grateful to have steady employment throughout this crisis. I am looking forward to the possibility of going to my husband's family's summer house on the water toward the end of the week (not definite, but TBD).","That we had some things in common - my partner is a student at a University that I am familiar with. Also, she was very easy going and pleasant to talk to. I wasn't sure what to expect with a video chat with a random person, but I honestly really enjoyed getting to talk to her. I especially liked hearing some cooking advice since I enjoy cooking foods from her culture.","Overall, it went really well and there was nothing that didn't work well.
