How we both started using the app about 2 months ago. We talked about some of the content on tiktok that was hilarious. I told her about how my students introduced me to TikTok the earlier part of the year and how I introduced it to my husband. However, it took me awhile to join.",9.0,9.0,9.0,We talked about my daughter and self esteem. How important it is to build a person’s self esteem and believing in yourself. The conversation was really engaging as we discussed how having manners and respect should always be valued and are apart of having a positive perspective in life.,9.0,9.0,9.0,Towards the end of the conversation we talked about politics. It was very intriguing as we both shared the same views on the politics of our nation. The unbelief of the things that are happening in society today and the likelihood of a positive change in January if our presidential candidate wins. We only hope as we look to changes in the economy as an effect response to COVID-19 be established.,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,7.0,7.0,9.0,100.0,11.0,100.0,100.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,1.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,"I think the week is going great.

Overall, its looking to be a great week in which I am going to complete tasks and spend quality time with my family.",I thinks we both had similar interests as we talked on social media. We both can relate on the medium and how it allows us both to relax and enjoy ourselves while reviewing a magnitude of content that is engaging and lighthearted. Our political viewpoints were also great as we shared similar views.,I guess us watching the time in the end. When we surpass the 25 minutes we both kept apologizing for talking more. I think we actually could have talked for hours because she felt like a friend even though we don’t know each other.
