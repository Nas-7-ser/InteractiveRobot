The plan right now is to go out on Friday and look for a cat to adopt, but something could pop up during the week that could derail that plan. Overall I see the week going fairly well. ","I think what worked well the most was that there were no technical difficulties during the conversation. We could hear and see each other clearly throughout. Also, it was very helpful to be paried with someone that had good energy and was genuinely interested in the conversation. That helped a ton. ","I think the thing that didn't work well in the conversation was that you felt a little pressured to keep the conversation going throughout. You don't want there to be any ""dead air"" between the two of you and with the clock running in the background you feel a slight sense of performance.

We are doing schooling from home for the kids and I am currently working from home so I see us spending a good ninety percent of our time at home this week, due to the pandemic and also, the weather. ",I think that we had similar work backgrounds gave us an ice breaker to figure out what else we could talk about. I am a pretty open person and like to have discussions with people about many different topics of interest and my partner seemed like he was as well. ,There were a few times where I felt unsure of what to talk about next. With the pandemic and elections going on I find myself slightly worried about saying something that could come off wrong or make someone upset.
