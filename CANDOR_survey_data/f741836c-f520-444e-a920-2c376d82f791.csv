I am excited to do my workouts this week. ,"Though there were awkward pauses, my partner was better at carrying on a conversation and making it flow through those pauses. We were both on the quieter side, which I think was a positive because both of us were conscious of giving the other person time to speak. It was comfortable. ","Occasionally there were moments were the conversation kind of abruptly died, through no fault of either party. It's normal to have lulls in a conversation, but for some reason those moments still feel a little awkward. I was a tad bit shy, which could have made it harder for the conversation to get rolling.
