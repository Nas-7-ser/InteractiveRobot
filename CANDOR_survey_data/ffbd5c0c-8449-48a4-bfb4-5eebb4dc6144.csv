My husband is working tomorrow so my son and I will probably just watch movies after I work and clean the house. Sunday will be pretty relaxed. We might have a Sunday dinner with some family but since we just started a diet I am not sure anyone is going to want to come. ,We were both friendly and asked a lot of questions. We stayed in safe conversation topics and did not try to get to personal. We had fun and tried a little to make each other laugh. I gave him tips on trying to make make money online. Even tho we are in very different places in our lives we were both nice and respectful. ,There were a few times were I felt he was trying to narrow down where I live and while I am sure that he did not mean anything by it it was a little creepy. There were also a few times where the conversation lagged and we had to think pretty hard about what to say next. ,5.0,4.0,2.0,6.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,7.0,7.0,1.0,60.0,40.0,4.0,7.0,9.0,5.0,3.0,9.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,14.0,,,4.0,14.0,,,3.0,2.0,3.0,6.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,female,1.0,white,associate_degree,1.0,,5.0,6.0,2.0,,False,,,28.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.875,5.333333333333333,,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.333333333333333,2.3333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,4.0,4.0,2.3333333333333335,4.333333333333333,4.0,2.3333333333333335,2.6666666666666665,,

I found out I will be furloughed in October so I’m going to have to cancel my plans to move to a new state and start looking for backup jobs to apply to for the next year or so. I’ll also have to get a surgery done before I lose my insurance.,I liked how we didn’t have anything specific to talk about so it left more room to get to know the person and go off on “off topic” diversions to connect more. It was very cool to see someone like me that did online work and what exactly they look and sound like too!,"There was obviously an age gap and she was a stay at home mom.
