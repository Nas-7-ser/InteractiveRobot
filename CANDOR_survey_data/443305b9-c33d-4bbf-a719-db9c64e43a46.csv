I talked about the wildfires after she asked me how the situation was. ,9.0,7.0,6.0,"We talked about so many topics and for so long that ""the middle"" was a big portion. I talked about my life in Japan and about the culture there. She talked about where she'd traveled and how she'd like to live somewhere that was not flat.

There are some unopened products by the door right now that I'll have to open and deal with. I also need to do some cooking, cleaning, and (online) food shopping. I'll have to pick up that food tomorrow morning and rush back home to tidy and clean before my husband starts working at 9:00 am (as he is working online now and the background if visible). So, I think the rest of my week will be very busy.","I think that our ages being similar meant we both had similar life experiences and were in the same place in our lives because of the perspective one gets with age. I also think she was the first partner I've had these conversations with (I've done this twice before with much younger partners) who has asked me questions that meant I spent more time speaking than my partner. I think this worked well because it's always easy to talk about yourself. Also, she seemed genuinely curious and interested rather than just going through the motions as my other partners did. The only thing that didn't really work was the technology. She was calling from a cell phone outdoors and the weather was distracting her and the connection was poor.","Everything seemed to work very well in the conversation. I can't think of much that didn't. She did a good job of dancing around any potential hot topics (e.g., politics). I think the only thing that may not have worked initially was her mentioning how difficult things are these days at a point at which pursuing it may have created conflict. I didn't address it, and I'm not sure that there would have been a conflict even if I had, but it was a moment that I felt cautious about the conversation.",2.0,3.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,60.0,40.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,9.0,2.0,2.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,,,4.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,6.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,female,6.0,white,bachelors_degree,6.0,,6.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,56.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.25,6.333333333333333,,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.333333333333333,4.0,5.0,3.3333333333333335,5.0,3.6666666666666665,4.333333333333333,3.3333333333333335,4.0,2.6666666666666665,,

Emotionally, though, it probably will be challenging. My husband’s job is extremely taxing, I have 3 sons and the oldest is autistic. So it’s never relaxing or easy at my house. ","My partner was talkative, pleasant and intelligent. She was easy to hold conversation with and interesting to listen to. It was easy to change subjects and we talked about a variety of topics. I think everything worked well. It helps to have a willing partner that can expound on different subjects. ","There wasn’t anything negative about our conversation. As I said earlier she was talkative, but easy to talk to.
