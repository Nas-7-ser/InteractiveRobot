We both had experiences in colleges that were similar, so it was fun getting to chat with someone who was in roughly the same boat. But it was also cool to hear about online schooling for her. I also liked when we talked about her parents and family. ",I probably could've let her talk or ask questions more. I felt like I dominated the conversation at times and I should've not always brought up myself after everything she said.

It also involves several hours of online tutoring (I tutor mostly high school math) and online classes. In the evenings on the weekend I will spend time with my friends. We usually play board games in the dorm lobby.,The conversation worked well when we found a topic that one or both of us could find funny and/or relate to each other. For example we laughed about my experiences with lawyer parents and she related that to her childhood experience watching law and order and told a funny anecdote. ,The conversation would die out a little when we got onto a topic one of couldn't rely relate to. It also didn't work as well when we tried to interrupt each other with anecdotes or comments.
