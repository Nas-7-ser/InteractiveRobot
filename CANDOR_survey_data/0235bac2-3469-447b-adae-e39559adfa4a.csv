It's the weekend so it's mostly going to be relaxing with my wife and child. I'm going to cook dinner on the smoker and watch football. Tomorrow we might try and go to the pumpkin patch as well. The weather is so nice we feel like we just have to spend time outside.,"We were both polite and cordial to each other despite talking about potentially tricky topics. We discussed many things of a political nature and we did not necessarily share the same opinions on things. However, we were able to have that conversation without any attacks or insults. We just had a good intelligent discussion.",There were times were my conversation partner was just a little awkward. He avoided eye contact with the camera and made lots of asides to himself while still talking. Most of them were self-deprecating which was kind of cringey. I did hope he felt ok with himself because I fear he might have some depression. ,2.0,5.0,7.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,3.0,7.0,7.0,6.0,45.0,55.0,4.0,7.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,7.0,7.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,20.0,,,4.0,18.0,,,5.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,7.0,6.0,8.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,male,4.0,white,professional_degree,1.0,,7.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,41.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.75,5.333333333333333,2.3333333333333335,2.6666666666666665,20.0,12.0,8.0,2.0,2.0,31.0,3.6666666666666665,4.666666666666667,2.6666666666666665,3.0,4.666666666666667,2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.3333333333333335,,

We also talked quite a bit about possible societal reactions after the election on November 3rd",7.0,7.0,7.0,My partner told me he was going to go trick or treating with his two year old daughter for Halloween and that she was going to dress up as a lion.

Realistically, as I mentioned to my partner, my mobility issues in my wheelchair will likely mean that I'm stuck in my bubble of being safe with relatives at home watching sports, which isn't a horrible situation, all things considered. ","I think both of us at least did not disagree with each others political and social beliefs. My partner actually agreed with me that Breonna Taylor should not be dead. His very agreeable reaction to my opinion surprised me quite a bit. We were both pleasant and easy going with each other, which was a relief. ","I was kind of stuck on subjects to talk about out of a nervous feeling I had meeting a new friend. This is usually my biggest flaw meeting new people. I think with my disabilities (plural), it takes me a couple of minutes to warm up to new people. Also, I tended to lead the conversation and didn't give my partner a chance to control discussion, but that was only after he expressed that he was stumped on what to talk about also.
