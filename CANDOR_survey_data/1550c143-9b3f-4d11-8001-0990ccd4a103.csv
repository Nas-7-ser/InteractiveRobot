I see it going really well and very quickly because I have so many to-dos. We are headed to the beach soon so that helps me get through the weeks as well. Work is picking up, mandatory appointments means a lot more virtual discussions and works",I think my ability to talk to anyone helped get the discussion going and keep going. I think my list of go-to questions was helpful too. Both of us being pleasant meant we were able to take turns and understand to pretend we were interested in one another. Laughing helps a little too,"Nothing in common. My partner seems like she is quiet and timid, so immediately I realized I had to try to carry the conversation. My iffy mood today made it harder for me to come up with decent topics and to be quick on my feet. If COVID weren't an issue, I don't know what we would've discussed since being at home dominated most of our conversation.
