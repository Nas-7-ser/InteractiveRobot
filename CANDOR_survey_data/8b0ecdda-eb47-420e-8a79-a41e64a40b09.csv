He was friendly, sharp and seemed to be interested in what I had to say to him and that made it much easier to stay interested in the conversation.","I can't recall anything non-technical that didn't work well. We both took turns leading, were attentive to the other as he talked and had familiarity with certain things that gave us a common ground, enabling easier conversation.

I could tell Todd was someone with whom I would have an easy time speaking. There is nothing negative I can really identify about the conversation, and the time was up before I knew it. It seemed to me like he felt the same way.","Like I said in the previous response, there was really no negative takeaway I had from the conversation. It was free flowing and natural.
