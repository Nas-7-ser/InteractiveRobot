We have been in quarantine for 2 months now and I have formed habits that make me feel healthy/well. As tragic as this pandemic is, it is teaching me how to insist on taking care of myself. I am making time for myself, for my physical and mental health (because we are surviving a unique situation) but I want to carry these positive habits forward. This includes openness to other people/new ideas and opinions.","we were both pleasantly surprised to see a real partner and realize we're both finally getting paid after 3 or 4 attempts (where we got stood up), we were similar in age - well I'm 6 years older but my brother, my cousins, my fiance's sisters, etc. are around my partner's age so I didn't find it hard to make conversation. Also I've been forced to make small talk in my customer-service facing jobs for the past few years so I'm a better conversationalist than I was before. He was nice, we were both open and honest instead of being non-communicative so that helped the conversation.","We were both uneasy about how long to keep the conversation going b/c we weren't sure if we could trust the timers since we logged on at different times but it wasn't that big of a deal. We were happy to chat, there was maybe an awkward pause between topics once or twice but that's to be expected between strangers.",6.0,5.0,3.0,6.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,8.0,4.0,55.0,45.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,3.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,20.0,,,4.0,18.0,,,2.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,female,6.0,white,bachelors_degree,1.0,,8.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.0,5.666666666666667,,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.3333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,4.666666666666667,4.666666666666667,3.0,4.333333333333333,3.3333333333333335,2.6666666666666665,4.333333333333333,,
