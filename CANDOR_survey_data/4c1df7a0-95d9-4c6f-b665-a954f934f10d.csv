I might even get to see a few more friends this weekend and I am looking forward to that if it happens too.","The fact that she had previously done one of these before allowed it to spark a conversation quite quickly, so no canned conversation starters were needed.  The fact that the world is currently in an odd state and the general desire to converse and be around people I feel also helped.  The fact that she was a delightful person was a great boon to it as well.","There was a bit of audio loss in the conversation, but that didn't impede anything too much.  The fact that video chats tend to make themselves more ""I talk, then you talk."" is a impeding factor I think.

I am a little concerned because my husband is having a gout flare up and I hope that he feels better, but I am optimistic about the rest of my week.  ","I think the conversation went well because we were both open to talking to a stranger and we had similar interests.  He was very kind and friendly, which made it easy to talk to him.  He was very extroverted and this helped with the conversation because if there was a moment when no one was talking, he was good at coming up with something to say.  I enjoyed talking to him.","I think the conversation went pretty well.  I think that if I had known more about his interest in video games, then we may have been able to continue our conversation or have a more in depth conversation about the games he likes to play.
