To be honest, my memory of the conversation is much better when we actually got to talking about certain things. My chat partner immediately struck me as a nice person, big smile and all, and I figured we would get along and have a pleasant conversation.  ",9.0,6.0,9.0,"We were kind of all over the place. We started talking about pandemic safety and she mentioned that she will soon be looking for a new roommate. Somehow my trying to give her advice swerved in the direction of baseball and analytics and the conversation became a free for all. We talked about family, baseball, kung fu, all sorts of things. I feel bad because I was never able to give her solid advice on a new roommate.    ",9.0,8.0,8.0,"We pretty much maintained the conversation we had going in the middle. I kind of tried steering the conversation back towards her upcoming roommate situation but I think she kind of moved past it at that point. Also, not to her fault, she pretty much ended the conversation when the time was up - I was enjoying the conversation and would have been willing to talk more. All in all she was a nice person and I wish her the best of luck.

I will work remotely from home and do the best job I can under these circumstances. What I will enjoy is all the time I get to spend with my family - my wife and kids have been great through these times and I feel we are as close as we ever have been as a family.   ,I think what worked well was basically our ability to talk to each other without having a clue who the other person was. I immediately liked my partner and felt at ease talking to her. I thought she was interesting and I sympathized with her upcoming problem about finding a roommate during a pandemic. She had a unique background and it was interesting to learn about it. ,My only problem with our conversation was regarding her upcoming problem about finding a new roommate during this pandemic. I feel I inadvertently steered the conversation to less important direction and never really gave her any good advice. I'm not sure if my advice would have been any good in the first place but I feel like I dropped the ball and wasn't as helpful as I could have been.  ,5.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,7.0,5.0,8.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,8.0,4.0,55.0,45.0,7.0,2.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,9.0,9.0,3.0,3.0,6.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,3.0,4.0,25.0,,,4.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,male,4.0,white,bachelors_degree,1.0,,8.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,39.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.25,5.333333333333333,,2.3333333333333335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.333333333333333,4.0,4.333333333333333,1.6666666666666667,4.333333333333333,2.6666666666666665,5.0,4.333333333333333,2.3333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,,
