Other than that, it's just staying in my apartment and trying to make money online. ","It was slow at first, as is usual when talking to someone you don't know. He was very helpful in giving me advice on other ways to earn money online. We got to talking about the pandemic and politics came up. We found that we both pretty much agreed on that. At the end, he talked about his sick bird and how much that was distressing him. I hope the bird will be okay.","I think it all worked pretty well considering we were very different in age, gender, and what part of the country we live in. It took a little bit to get comfortable in the conversation but there wasn't much awkwardness. So I can't say anything didn't work well other than I think we both were not feeling great.
