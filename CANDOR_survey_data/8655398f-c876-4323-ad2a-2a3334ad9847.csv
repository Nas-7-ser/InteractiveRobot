Our names are similar. She said she just graduated from college. I'm at the other end of the spectrum. Then we talked about our dogs. She told me that they fostered a dog that had 15 puppies. Then actually have one of the puppies because a family couldn't keep it for whatever reason. We talked about how loud my dogs were snoring (although of course when I say that they didn't really snore during our conversation.),7.0,6.0,6.0,"We talked about the animals around our houses. She has deer, fox, cougars, squirrels, chipmunks and gophers. And they did have a bear wander nearby recently but that isn't normal. By my house we have the same (minus gophers) plus possum. And we had a cougar nearby which also isn't normal for where I live. ",8.0,7.0,7.0,"We talked about weather. They get hurricanes where she lives. I get snow and sub zero temperatures. Then we talked about her playing ultimate frisbee which is something I've only ever seen on tv, maybe because it's pretty cold where I live so there might not be as much opportunity. I got her to give me some tips on how to throw a straight frisbee because I'm horrible at it.",5.0,3.0,8.0,7.0,8.0,6.0,4.0,3.0,70.0,5.0,75.0,28.0,3.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,1.0,8.0,5.0,9.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,7.0,6.0,9.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,7.0,6.0,8.0,I see the rest of my week going pretty well. The temperature is going to start dropping but it's not going to get too cold yet so I like that. I have an appointment at a salt lodge which I'm really looking forward to trying. I hope it helps with some headaches I'm having. My friend swears by it so I'm willing to try it. I'm hoping to find a topic to give a speech on for Toastmasters this week (I was researching ideas before our call). I also hope to get the dogs out on walks most days while the temps are still good and there's no rain.,I think we were both committed to going 25 minutes so we both had ideas of things to talk about if the conversation died down. I think we also both had follow-up questions for the other person so we felt engaged even if we didn't have a lot of common ground. I think the set-up worked well. We could both be somewhere that we felt comfortable so we were more relaxed in that sense.,I kept talking a lot. I felt like I talked over her sentences. I'm not sure if I was nervous or worried that we wouldn't have enough to talk about or if I'm still not comfortable talking online so I just keep saying stuff. I felt kind of rude. I hate having to ask people to repeat stuff especially when it's due to me talking over them. And I hate people that talk over others in general so I was even more annoyed by it. I think the conversation felt awkward at first because we weren't really sure what we were supposed to do but that kind of faded as we got into it.,6.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,8.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,6.0,7.0,5.0,70.0,30.0,6.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,8.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,25.0,,,4.0,7.0,,,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,6.0,8.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,female,3.0,white,masters_degree,1.0,,8.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,50.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.5,5.333333333333333,1.0,1.0,24.0,14.0,12.0,2.0,0.0,25.0,4.0,3.3333333333333335,2.6666666666666665,1.6666666666666667,4.333333333333333,2.6666666666666665,4.333333333333333,4.666666666666667,1.6666666666666667,3.6666666666666665,,

The book I've been reading is getting good so I'm looking forward to that, plus I recently scheduled a distanced visit with my significant other. I've got some yard work to do tomorrow which I would normally be not excited about but this time I'll be cutting down a tree instead of just pulling weeds.","We had a medium amount in common, but what we did have in common we were able to talk a lot about and what we didn't have in common we were each curious to learn about the other person. I think we both were optimistic and had an open mind going into the conversation. I for one didn't have any expectations at all, so I was just preparing for a potentially awkward conversation with a stranger.","There were a few times the conversation lulled, mainly as our topic(s) were coming to an end. Several times there were short pauses as we each tried to think of something new to say or a new topic to talk or ask about.
