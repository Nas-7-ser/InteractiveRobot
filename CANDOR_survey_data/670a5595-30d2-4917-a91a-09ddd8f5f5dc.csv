I plan on working on two projects. I need to work out 5 days a week. I also need to connect with my friends and family on Zoom. I also need to do a bit of decluttering. Lastly, I have a lot of papers to file. ",We talked about what we had in common. We are in a global pandemic. We discussed the items that are difficult to receive right now such as toilet paper. We also discussed our feelings about how the crisis is being handled. We did not shy away from political and financial topics. This was a vulnerable conversation. ,I know I wasn't as open because it was our first time meeting. I wasn't sure if we held the same political beliefs. I was also conscious that this is a video chat so there is not as much anonymity here. I want to be open but I need to protect myself.  ,5.0,7.0,8.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,40.0,60.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,8.0,8.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,2.0,,,4.0,25.0,,,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,8.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,,female,4.0,black_or_african_american,masters_degree,1.0,,7.0,6.0,2.0,,False,,,38.0,12.0,,35.0,0.0,25.0,30.0,10.0,0.0,70.0,10.0,20.0,0.0,3.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,,4.0,,,,5.875,6.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,4.0,4.333333333333333,2.3333333333333335,4.666666666666667,3.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,2.6666666666666665,2.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,family,video_chat

I have language studies to do and need to look for a new job and I’m leaving town for four days for my birthday. So I’m really excited about that and we’re gonna have some great food and check and be on the beach and just relax.,We had a lot in common were both very friendly and we shared similar views on the virus situation and politics and it was also really interesting because we have different lives so we got to talk about how our lives have been affected by all of this. It was great.,"There was nothing that didn’t work well. We got along well, the conversation flowed easily and there was plenty to talk about. It was very easy it was like talking to someone I’ve known for a while and the video quality was good and the sound quality was good so there were no issues and it was just like having a conversation with a friend.
