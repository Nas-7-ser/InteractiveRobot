I would like to get out and do some outdoor activities like disc golf or hiking or something similar to that. Other than that may jang out with my friend lindsay and watch some netflix or rent a movie or something like that,we were of the same age range and had similar life experiences. Both could relate a lot to travel and having kids. We both have been several places and some common areas. We both had similar personalities as well in my opinion. It was overall an easy conversation to have had,i do not see very much that did not work. My partner did not have ant kids of her own so maybe it was a bit hard for her to relate to my stories about all my kids. I feel however we both have similar  experiences and goals in life,5.0,5.0,1.0,9.0,5.0,1.0,8.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,8.0,8.0,6.0,8.0,2.0,70.0,30.0,6.0,2.0,3.0,7.0,6.0,9.0,9.0,3.0,1.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,,2.0,,4.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,male,4.0,white,associate_degree,1.0,,6.0,5.0,2.0,,False,,,42.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.75,6.333333333333333,,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.6666666666666665,3.0,4.0,3.3333333333333335,2.6666666666666665,4.333333333333333,3.6666666666666665,2.3333333333333335,4.666666666666667,,
