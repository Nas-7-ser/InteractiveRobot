I had a very engaging and life-changing conversation with a person that felt very natural. It made me feel very happy and at peace. I see this conversation being the pep talk that I needed for inspiration this week. I will be walking on cloud nine and focused on living life to the fullest. I see my life for the rest of the week having a glow surrounding it and making me smile. It's amazing what a conversation can do for your life.,It worked well being open and allowing the conversation to naturally flow. We both took times listening to each other and taking in what the other person had to say. I believe it was due to the fact that we both respected each other and what we had to say. We didn't try to over-talk each other. We spent time making sure our thoughts came out. It was really nice building context with words and not just sound bites. The conversation was real and didn't seem fake in any way.  ,"Holding back what we wanted to say didn't work well. We started off a little cautious about what we wanted to verbally express, but I found that wouldn't result in a genuine conversation. I made the decision to be very open after a few minutes to let my conversation partner know it was okay (non-verbally) to say exactly what was on her mind.",5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,8.0,9.0,9.0,4.0,55.0,45.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,7.0,9.0,9.0,3.0,3.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,,1.0,6.0,4.0,25.0,,,6.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,female,6.0,black_or_african_american,masters_degree,1.0,,8.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,42.0,7.0,,0.0,0.0,90.0,0.0,10.0,90.0,0.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.875,6.666666666666667,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.333333333333333,4.333333333333333,4.0,2.3333333333333335,5.0,5.0,4.333333333333333,4.666666666666667,2.0,5.0,friends,in_person

I think we will continue to unpack and decorate. I think we will continue exploring new places in the city. Sometime next week we'll be visiting Mount Hood and the surrounding area.,We immediately started with something in common (where we lived). We knew about a lot of the same places and people. He listened well and had lots to add. It wasn't difficult coming up with things to talk about. We didn't introduce ourselves until about half way into the conversation.,"He was long winded at several points. I found myself forcing myself to pay attention. The fact that one topic led into another kept the conversation moving but it would also cause him to go on a tangent, some of the five links deep at a time.
