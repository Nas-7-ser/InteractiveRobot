We had stuff to talk about that we could relate, especially about Covid. Since it was the most life changing event we could relate to. I just talked about my experiences and my plans and asked how'd it went for her. ","I did not feel as we had any bad conversation. Maybe a few seconds of silence.

This experience gave us something to talk about for the majority of the conversation. We easily transitioned into other topics. We both made an effort to listen and relate to each other. We both avoided stating opinions of potentially controversial topics.,"We wanted to avoid giving detailed information about our lives to a stranger and the research team, so important details that would be shared with a friend were left out.
