Maybe I will be able to incorporate more conversation into my daily activity. I feel more motivated to do more activities. I would like to spend more time reaching out to friends or learning as I had planned. I expect my week to be pleasant. ,"Since the world is at a collective standstill we both had a topic of conversation that we were familiar with and that we had a lot of time to think about. We were both very polite and able to let the other speak their mind without frequent interruptions, I think our conversation went well. ",My video brightness could have been better but all in all the video quality was good. The video and audio did not lag and we could both hear and see each other. One qualm with the conversation that I just had was that the video and audio did cut out for a minute but beside that the conversation went seamlessly.,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,45.0,55.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,9.0,8.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,25.0,,,4.0,25.0,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,7.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,female,4.0,black_or_african_american,some_college,7.0,Student,6.0,6.0,2.0,,False,,,20.0,1.0,,100.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,3.0,4.0,7.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,5.125,6.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.6666666666666665,4.0,2.6666666666666665,4.0,5.0,2.3333333333333335,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,family,in_person

Our cabin will be in the woods and away from everyone. It will be a much needed getaway for both of us. We are going to be doing hiking and just relaxing. We are going to stay there for 3 days.,We both stuck to the subject and had very well thought out answers. It was a nice flow of back and forth and they contributed as much as me. It was not awkward at all and she was easy to talk to. You never know how these will go in talking to someone you have no idea who they are. ,I can't think of much that did not work. We both contributed. I guess the only thing I can think of is I has to talk a little more to keep it going and sometimes she would not acknowledge what I said and would just go to what she wanted to say. But this was minor to me.,5.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,6.0,5.0,9.0,7.0,3.0,60.0,40.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,3.0,5.0,,1.0,3.0,5.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,male,4.0,white,bachelors_degree,1.0,,7.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,36.0,10.0,,10.0,80.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,80.0,10.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.875,6.333333333333333,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.6666666666666665,4.0,4.333333333333333,2.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,5.0,4.666666666666667,1.3333333333333333,4.0,romantic_partner,in_person
