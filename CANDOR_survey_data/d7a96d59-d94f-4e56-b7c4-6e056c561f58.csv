I said that the smoke had been pretty nonexistent the past couple weeks and she said the same. I also talked about the previous fire we had in SoCal around a decade ago.",7.0,7.0,6.0,We talked about her job and what kind of people she worked with and how the pandemic is causing a lot of work from home and changing dynamics. We also talked about the housing and transportation issues in the Bay Area and how expensive things are.,7.0,7.0,8.0,"We continued talking about how expensive things are, how I saw snow for the first time last November, her opinions on snow, potentially moving away from our current locations.

I feel like my energy levels aren't super great this week and that it would be nice to get out and get some sun. I also need to drop a package off at the post office which should go smoothly. I will most likely take my dog on a walk every day which should be enjoyable as well, especially since the weather is good and the air is clear.",Our conversational styles matched well and we were able to bounce off each other despite some hiccups due to the video chat. She was intelligent and able to give her opinion on topics I talked about despite not being from the area. She paid attention and thought critically about what I was saying so we could have a good constructive conversation.,We don't have very similar backgrounds and upbringings so some of the stories about snow and Boston and Oregon I didn't really relate to. I also didn't really relate to her stories about working in a startup type environment with guys who were friends as CEOs. Her not being from the Bay also made it a little difficult for her to understand some of my frustrations with living here,6.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,6.0,45.0,55.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,6.0,9.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,5.0,,1.0,2.0,5.0,,2.0,,3.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,female,4.0,asian,bachelors_degree,1.0,,6.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,25.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.375,6.333333333333333,2.0,1.3333333333333333,26.0,8.0,8.0,5.0,0.0,37.0,2.0,4.666666666666667,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.333333333333333,4.0,4.333333333333333,2.0,3.6666666666666665,,

Both being on the west coast gave us ample topics to discuss, as there have been fires that have affected people all along the coast. We were similar in age and were both women in mail dominated offices. ","There were some lulls in the conversation, especially when a topic was over. These gaps were quickly filled and both of us were able to jump in to talk about any topic the other brought up.
