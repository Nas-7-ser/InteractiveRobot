Overall, it's going to be a relaxed week.","My partner was very easy to talk to. It was easy enough to keep the conversation going. There weren't any awkward silences and each of us contributed enough to the conversation. It was quite a lot easier than previous conversations in these studies. Given, that probably has a lot to do with my own energy levels, too.","I can't really say that there was any negative aspect to the conversation we had. It went well enough and the task was smooth. I did have a little trouble hearing them at times, but I'm not sure if that was just my own volume level, as it was initially low.

We also had quite a bit in common concerning our families so that made the conversations last much longer when we talked about them as well.
