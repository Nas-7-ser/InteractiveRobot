I am looking forward to the rest of a relaxing Sunday, with my favorite sports team playing later today. The work week is not expected to be too draining and I am very much looking forward to Thanksgiving and all the preparation it entails. ",What worked well in the conversation I just had was our desire to let each other speak on the subjects that were brought up. I believe we both tried to give the other person time to speak on a topic before moving away from that topic to something else. I think that having the opportunity to speak on each topic is comforting for all parties involved in the conversation. ,"My conversation partner and I had some large differences in our lives and therefore perspectives which tripped up our conversation at different points. I believe we are about the same age but she had a son in HS while I have no children, she is financially comfortable while my wife and I struggle occasionally and they are home owners while we rent. On the surface these seem like just materialistic differences but it also adds layers to a persons life, making some questions for me not relevant for her or vice versa.

I do this when I am interested in things.  Also, over the last 8 months as quarantine has gone on I think I have become more desperate for conversation as I don't see people anymore. So I think I am getting worse and tempering my excitement to see any person.","Oops, I think I just switched these questions, What I said in the last one was what didn't work well... Basically I am talking too much and not listening enough.  What went well, was that he was an attentive and great listener.
