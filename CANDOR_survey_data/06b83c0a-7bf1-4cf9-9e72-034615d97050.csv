I think my week will go pretty well as long as I stay at home and maintain social distancing! I will be studying some topics on my own for school and then doing other fun hobbies.,"The conversation really opened my eyes to a new perspective on life! My conversation partner lived on the opposite side of the country in a state that I have never visited, and he gave me great life advice! I think that he was wonderful and I would have never been able to have a conversation with somebody like him if this wasn't arranged! I found it really enjoyable and I learned so much!",The conversation worked great! I thought that it was very enjoyable and my partner had great insights. We had many different topics and I could relate a lot to what he was speaking about. The age difference also made it very interesting for me because I felt like I could trust him and tell him about my life!,5.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,9.0,6.0,50.0,50.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,8.0,9.0,9.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,4.0,5.0,,1.0,4.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,7.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,female,2.0,asian,some_college,7.0,Student,8.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,19.0,5.0,,70.0,0.0,25.0,0.0,5.0,70.0,20.0,0.0,10.0,0.0,3.0,7.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,1.0,,4.0,,,,6.25,6.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.666666666666667,3.6666666666666665,2.3333333333333335,4.333333333333333,3.6666666666666665,5.0,4.666666666666667,4.333333333333333,1.6666666666666667,3.6666666666666665,family,in_person
