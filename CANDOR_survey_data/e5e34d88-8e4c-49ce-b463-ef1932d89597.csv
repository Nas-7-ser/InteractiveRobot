My partner seemed interested in getting to know me, and I also asked good questions to engage her. She shared openly about how things are going, and was willing to respond to what I was saying.

She smiled a lot and used encouraging facial expressions.","We had maybe two or three pauses in the conversation, which was not terrible, just some normal ""strangers talking to each other"" type pauses. I wanted to ask more about her job, but by the time I had formed a question I felt like we had moved on to other topics.
