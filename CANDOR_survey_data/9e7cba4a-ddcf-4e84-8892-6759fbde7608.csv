He talked about being a student and UCSB and I talked about being a software dev in Sacramento, CA.",7.0,7.0,7.0,We talked about memory and how it works as that is what he does in college.

I see myself taking time to go to church on Sunday and then spending more time with family.  Next Tuesday I will take some time off to go hunting in the national forest and spend some more time outside.,"I think that we had some specific topics that were interesting to both of us.  We specifically talked about memory, as that is what he studies, quite a lot.  He is a smart guy and I was able to bounce questions off of him.  Overall really chill and nice talk.",I think that the only problem that we might have had is that we are in very different phases of life.  I'm in my mid-forties and have four kids and a wife.  He is a full-time student working on his PHD and is neither married nor does he have kids.

He's a software engineer and has worked at a company for 20 years. However, he can't advance to a hire position without having a degree, so he is forced to get a degree in things he already knows just to be able to get promoted. I told him about my graduate program and he said his sister got a Master's degree in Industrial Psychology.",8.0,6.0,8.0,"I talked about my memory research and he discussed his experiences. He told me about a TED talk he heard where they discussed how small bonuses makes people more productive if it is a repetitive task, but can actually hurt productivity if the task is complex because people get anxiety or think about the bonus which may distract them. He also mentioned how sometimes having a larger bonus is hindersome because adds extra stress to the works. He also talked about his trip to Yellowstone and how the Grand Tetons were smoking.

There weren't any times where we had awkward pauses. The conversation kept flowing. We were able to relate each others' experiences with our own despite having much different work backgrounds. We were able to joke around a little bit and share some laughs. I thought his stories were genuinely interesting so it was easy to follow what he was saying.,"He's older with kids, so it was hard to relate to him a bit. We didn't have a ton of things in common, so it was hard to find things to talk about in a more detailed way.
