I am looking forward to going to clinicals again especially because I get to see the OR this time. I think I will have a good time in my classes and learning about the new material from my professor. ,I think what worked well was that we both had very similar views. We both thought about the same things and we knew how to have a conversation. I think we both sympathized and empathized with each other which really helped the conversation keep going. We were very friendly to each other. ,"I think what didn't work out well was that we both didn't really know what to say at moments. But this wasn't very often. We also had points where we would overlap or we would mishear what the other person said. With that being said, I don't think there was anything that was too bad.
