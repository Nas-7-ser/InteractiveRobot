Lots to get done before the holiday.  Also, I'm stressed because I have to go into the office again for the first time in months.  Additionally, I'm busy at home and irritable due to the risk of going to the office everyday.  That is causing more tension and stress at home...which isn't great either.  Overall, if I could push the fast forward button to next year I would (provided I don't die this year that is).","I had some knowledge of India and Indian culture as well as some knowledge of Houston so I was able to ask some decent questions about his life.  We both had families so that was an easy thing to share common experiences on.  Of course with Covid-19, that is like an required topic in any conversation for the past 4 months.  It's weird how ready everyone is talk about it still.  ","His internet lagged a little which caused some difficulty.  Also, English was a second language for him so I had to carry a little more of the conversation than I normally would have.  That being said, his English was very good.

Also we shared similar interests and hobbies like travelling to new places, open to try eating new food, mingle with different culture.  We had some common goals, road map, family bonding. In addition to that we traveled to the same places in the past.","Nothing in specific to be honest.  Most of the conversation has been wonderful. The person was nice, kind and understandable.
