Then he was able to give me some advice on things to expect and prepare for.",The person I talked to Matthew had a lot of energy from the start and it seemed like he was engaged and invested in the conversation the whole time. This made it much easier to have a conversation with and as a result made the conversation to go more smoothly.,"Everything based on our conversation went well, we were able to make some connections, make recommendations to each other, and more.

The worst part will probably be tomorrow when I get an organic chemistry exam back, but other then that I'll have a relatively relaxing weekend. I'll probably try to enjoy it as much as I can, considering the following week will have to be mainly about finals.","I think what really worked well was that the both of us happened to be biology majors, but were at different years of schooling. It meant that we had similar interests and directions in life as far as our degree is concerned, but still had plenty to talk about. Hopefully it was better to talk to someone who is further into the same degree.","I felt like my conversation partner was a little awkward at times, maybe due to being a little nervous or just not that good with conversation. Although it also could be because he was a little younger. I also felt that wearing a mask made it harder to gauge emotion and how the conversation was going. I was left with cheek raises for smiles or other context clues that didn't involve the lower half of the face.
