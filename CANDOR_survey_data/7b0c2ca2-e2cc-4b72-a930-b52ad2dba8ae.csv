Stressed out with household chores and trying to catch up with them while getting things ready for the next gaming giveaway for me streaming channel. Lots of work to do and not a lot of time.,Meeting eye to eye with gaming and the fact I am streaming and him wanting to know more about upcoming games and the related. He was curious about what I played/streamed and what I think of a few games coming out soon as well as how I play games on a remote service.,"I saw a lot of forehead and the video dropped out a few times. I am not entirely sure though but he was more of the quiet type and didn't say as much as he was asking.

I am done with the stressful parts of my week and I am looking forward to just relaxing and chilling at home. I hope the covid cases won't go higher and I can really enjoy life and hopefully Thanksgiving. Thats about it,It worked well because my partner and I had a lot of similarities and we were able to really connect. He was able to give me some advice and I really appreciate him and the help he has rendered. He is an amazing guy and really good at what he does.,Nothing honestly. I think my video cut out a few times but not too bad and we were still able to hear each other. Oh and his video lagged for the last five minutes but the voice was still okay.
