My conversation partner mentioned that she was in Michigan traveling and was originally from the south. I mentioned that I was in North Dakota. Interestingly enough she said that her sister went to grad school in the same town I lived in and in the same department I am currently going to school in. ,8.0,7.0,7.0,"She mentioned that as she was traveling she noticed a pumpkin that she had picked up and left in her trunk was rolling around. We shared a laugh because as her and her husband had been traveling, they were seeing signs for pumpkins.",9.0,9.0,8.0,"We exchanged stories about how the weather patterns were in our residing states. She talked about how in Michigan they get snow in the winter that just sort of stays around but rarely gets below 0 (degrees). She asked about weather in ND and I told her how it gets cold and dry due to the wind, but we do get some snow.

I may get up and work before that but that depends on how my workout this evening treats me. After the game I will likely work on school stuff or help on manuscript writing for my job. After tomorrow, I had originally planned to attend a few meetings but I am not sure if they will be held due to columbus day. Later on in the week I will attend a few more meetings, have class on Wednesday, and hopefully get caught up there. ","We definitely had similar experiences. We both live in the Midwest. Unfortunately, I did not ask if she went to college but it seemed like she was educated and maybe had a professional or graduate degree. She had a son who is an undergrad so we were able to talk about his experiences going to school as a freshman in college during COVID. The weirdest part of the conversation was about her sister (in-law?), who went to graduate school at my same program in my current city. She seemed very intelligent and was very good at holding a conversation. ","It is actually very difficult to think of things that didn't work well beyond video quality. There was one instance where we started speaking at the same time and she let me speak, which made me feel like I was being domineering, however it did not seem to genuinely bother her. I did not ask as much about her as she did me, however those things did come up naturally. In sum I would say that the conversation did not flow as naturally as I like them to.",5.0,8.0,9.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,8.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,9.0,50.0,50.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,9.0,9.0,2.0,2.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,18.0,,,4.0,23.0,,,5.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,4.0,7.0,7.0,3.0,8.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,male,6.0,white,masters_degree,1.0,,9.0,6.0,2.0,,False,,,29.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,3.0,2.0,6.125,7.0,2.3333333333333335,1.0,29.0,5.0,14.0,4.0,0.0,29.0,4.0,4.333333333333333,1.6666666666666667,4.0,4.333333333333333,3.3333333333333335,4.666666666666667,4.666666666666667,1.3333333333333333,5.0,,

Easier and more efficient for him. I also have regular chore jobs like taking the dogs tothe groomer and grocery shopping to do. ",It worked well that we were both Midwestern and educated so we had some common points of things to talk about. We each knew enough about what the other was doing to have an easy flowing conversation about where we were and what we were doing and deer season too,A couple of times we both wanted to talk at the same time and that was a bit awkward. It also was slightly annoying to me that he sped the entire time we talked.
