Then we talked about Jeffrey Epstein and how he is a creep. Then I think we talked about where I grew up.,7.0,7.0,6.0,"I think we started talking about politics following the Jeffrey Epstein conversation. We had opposing opinions but were respectful to each others ideas, which was refreshing.

I'll wake up every day slowly to a cup of coffee while I soak in the bathtub for about an hour. Then I'll play a round of video games and get something to eat afterwards. After that I'll likely work if I'm feeling up to it.,"What worked well is that both my partner and I are were willing to hear each others opinions without insulting or being rude to one another. Typically when online and discussing politics or other sensitive ideas, people get rather hostile very quickly. Being able to see another human on the end gives you the ability to be more kind and rational.","Other than not knowing what to talk about, I don't think anything really went wrong during the conversation. It would have been nice to maybe have slightly clearer directions. The interaction went well in my opinion and I can't think of anything that went wrong, so I'm trying to get to 50 words.

Either way I think the rest of my week should be productive and relaxing.,I think that both of us were good conversationalists. The conversation flowed from one topic to the next and we both had an equal amount of input. We both felt comfortable asking and answering questions and there was never really any awkward moments even when we discovered that we had opposing political views.,"Although we didn't give each other a hard time about opposing political views, this aspect caused a bit of tension. It is sometimes hard to gage how staunch someone is about political beliefs, so it easily could have gone south if either of us were super radical. I wanted to be extra careful when I learned that he supported Trump to make sure that an argument didn't start.
