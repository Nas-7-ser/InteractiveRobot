Today is Saturday and Monday is a holiday so I get an extended weekend. My kids also will have Monday off so we should be able to spend a good amount of time getting things done around the house today so that we can really enjoy the rest of the 3 day weekend. ,It was nice that we both had something in common that we could talk about. Since we are both living in the same area it was easy to talk about things that we know. It felt like we already had something in common so it made it easy to talk about other things that we might have in common. ,The sound seemed like it was lagging a little bit. I also got some feed back from her end so I would say something and then hear myself say it again. I also had a couple of intrusions by my kiddos that disrupted the conversation a little bit. But other than that I feel like the conversation was great. ,6.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,5.0,9.0,9.0,7.0,40.0,60.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,8.0,9.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,5.0,,1.0,3.0,5.0,,1.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,male,1.0,white,bachelors_degree,1.0,,6.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,29.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.125,6.666666666666667,1.0,1.0,29.0,12.0,15.0,9.0,10.0,23.0,3.6666666666666665,5.0,5.0,1.0,2.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,4.333333333333333,4.0,2.0,3.3333333333333335,,

We talked about what a small world it is.  He was helping a neighbor from his church move in and found out that they had attended the high school where they moved from.

I think it will continue to impact my future weeks.  I won't be working this week.  I will have to find things to do around the home.  I will read books and play a video game part of the time.  I might have dinner with a friend.  My weeks are not exciting at the moment.  I still try to remain safe and stay inside when possible.,"He was open and discussed and/or answered everything we talked about.  He did not shy away from questions.  He carried half of the conversation.  I did not have to do all the talking. He was easy to talk to.  It ended up that we both live near each other, and that was interesting to find out.","When his cell phone rang, it paused the video on his side.  Although I could hear him, I could not see him for the minute or two that the phone continued to ring.  He did apologize for that and it did not bother me.  Near the beginning of our conversation, he had to take a minute to tend to his baby because his wife was out of the house and he was home alone with his four kids. There weren't really spots that didn't work well for me,  All in all, it was an easy conversation.",5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,8.0,7.0,3.0,50.0,50.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,,2.0,,6.0,6.0,5.0,7.0,6.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,female,2.0,white,bachelors_degree,3.0,,8.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,52.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.75,5.333333333333333,2.0,1.0,28.0,13.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,32.0,4.0,4.333333333333333,4.666666666666667,3.6666666666666665,5.0,3.0,4.333333333333333,4.0,3.0,3.0,,
