Talked about the weather out in Washington although he thinks we are much colder than we really are.",4.0,4.0,5.0,"We talked about working/not working. I asked him how the pandemic has changed his plans for the year, he mentioned he missed going to the movie theater but recently went to 3 movies. I asked the names of the movies and he told me a bit about them and the titles. We talked about being safe at the movie theater. Also chatted about air travel and whether or not any vacation plans had been interrupted. ",3.0,4.0,7.0,"We moved into politics and the upcoming election. I asked him how the voting process worked in NJ, he told me he wasn't a registered voter. I then talked to him about how important voting can be at the local and state level, not just voting for president. He remained unconvinced and said he wasn't interested in registering to vote.

Online schooling will probably dominate my thoughts as I'm still helping my teenager adjust to a virtual school. I need to check in on his work every day to make sure he stays on track. I'm over a deadline on a special work project and will probably need to stay up late tonight to finish it up.",He listened closely and we had an even exchange of sharing conversation. He didn't hold back in bringing up potentially difficult topics and had not problem sharing his opinion on them. There were not noticeable lags in the conversation and we were able to keep it going without any difficulty. ,This is the first conversation I've had where I didn't feel like I connected with the person very well. We did not have a lot in common and it felt like he was a bit disconnected from the world so my usual conversation topics weren't useful as I usually ask about work and family. ,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,3.0,7.0,7.0,2.0,60.0,40.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,8.0,7.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,12.0,,,4.0,20.0,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,female,4.0,white,bachelors_degree,1.0,,5.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,53.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,5.0,3.0,3.0,24.0,6.0,9.0,3.0,0.0,31.0,2.6666666666666665,4.333333333333333,2.0,3.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,1.6666666666666667,2.6666666666666665,1.3333333333333333,4.666666666666667,2.0,,

We both always had a topic we could talk about and not really have to struggle to have a conversion.  We both had a sense of humor and could joke around a little bit.,"I would say sometimes there was a power struggle to control the conversion and voice oneâ€™s opinion or words over the other.
