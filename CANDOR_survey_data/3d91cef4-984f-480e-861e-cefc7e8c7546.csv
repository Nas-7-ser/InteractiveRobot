I overdid it yesterday and am a bit low on energy and not feeling very well today. But I am doing a lot of laundry today and some cooking. Tomorrow, I need to work on Christmas planning and some clean up and clean out chores around the house. ",I feel like we have a strong similarity in being people whose hearts lie in the small town life. That gave me a sense that this was a person similar to me in worldview. It was also helpful that we both started out in a similar career field so that gave us some early things to talk about and had the shared experience of the recent selling of a family home. ,"During the first half, I thought we both seemed somewhat distracted and unengaged from the conversation. My conversation partner seemed to maybe have a hard time coming up with topics to talk about.

I think that it also worked out well that she knew how this would go a little bit since it was my first time trying to complete one of these. It was helpful to be having a conversation with someone that knew what we were doing.,"I don't think anything didn't work out well specifically. I often worry that I'm talking too much and not letting the other person participate in the story of a conversation.
