I feel like I will likely get things done eventually. I will need to leave the house sometime this week to get Thanksgiving supplies, I am kind of worried about this as COVID lockdowns are currently in effect. ",We had a good long talk about similar technical things once we realized we both knew that we had technical knowledge of energy policy and equipment. We also talked about the weather and COVID easily without drifting into deep political things. We also have similar opinions on the stock market. ,It started out kind of awkward- I think I am much more extroverted than he is so maybe I dominated the conversation a bit too much. I also felt a bit awkward when his (wife?) came in to ask if he was done with the conversation. I also think I couldn't explain myself properly in some instances.,1.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,8.0,3.0,5.0,6.0,8.0,6.0,8.0,8.0,2.0,60.0,40.0,7.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,3.0,9.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,2.0,4.0,15.0,,,4.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,6.0,3.0,7.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,female,6.0,white,bachelors_degree,2.0,,6.0,6.0,2.0,,False,,,39.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.125,6.0,,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.6666666666666665,4.333333333333333,3.6666666666666665,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.666666666666667,1.3333333333333333,3.6666666666666665,,

I have to finish some at home projects and then will resume my shift work again on Saturday. I will probably enjoy some sunshine today or tomorrow before the snow comes again.  I also imagine being productive at work for my new projects.,We were able to make some introductions and to find some common ground.  We both have similar education levels and had some common interests to help move the conversation forward.  It also helped that we both were in the same environment/senario of a research conversation with a stranger from our laptops at home.,I was nervous at first that the age of the person would be an issue.  They seemed to be younger that I was and single rather than married with kids like I am.
