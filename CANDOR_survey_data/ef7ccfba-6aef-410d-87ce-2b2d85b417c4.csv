I only have 2 days of work, so I get to enjoy some time off. I also am going on a date with the wife on Saturday. Hopefully get something good to eat. As long as I am able to get a workout in and get some decent sleep, the rest of the week should go pretty well. ","She seemed extremely friendly and had some fun things to talk about involving her cultural background. She was younger and didn't really seem to be as socially awkward as some of the people that I have spoken to in that past. Even though I did much of the heavy lifting in the conversation, I think that she probably would have been fine to help carry on the conversation.  ","I probably am guilty of doing most of the heavy lifting in asking questions and follow up questions during this conversation. If I wouldn't have been so aggressive in asking so many questions, it might have been easier for her to ask me questions. I also found that I would prompt information about myself really without her asking for it which might be annoying.
