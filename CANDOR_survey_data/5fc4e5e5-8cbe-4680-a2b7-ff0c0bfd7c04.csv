That being said, my partner has an upcoming life event that will make life pretty stressful until it is over next Tuesday. As such, I think I'll be stressed about that for the remainder of the week. ","I think that despite the age difference, my conversation partner and I had a decent amount in common. I surmised that we probably shared political leaning based upon some of his commentary on politics, so that was common ground. In addition, we shared some interest in the area in which we live which is pretty close together and in some hobbies and interests. ","I think there's a component of discomfort to talking to a stranger that I had to adjust to at first. There was also the factor of time, an expectation of a specific duration of conversation changed the dynamic to some degree such that we were both keeping an eye on time while we talked.
