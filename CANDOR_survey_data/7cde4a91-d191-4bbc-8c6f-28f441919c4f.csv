We both mentioned that we liked the same show, Breaking Bad, and we both liked long boarding. We also were able to talk about open ended topics such as weather quite easily as well which kept the conversation going. ","I felt as though my conversation partner did not have much of a personality or rather, he did not have anything that he really wanted to talk about throughout the conversation. I also felt as though he did not take the initiative throughout the conversation and I felt as though I was the one that had to lead the conversation and ask questions.

Im excited to leave so going to work for the next few days is going to feel like an eternity.,When i first clicked the link and it immediately loaded me into a conversation i felt really awkward but my mic and camera were disabled by accident so i had to restart google chrome. After chatting for a few seconds with the person i was matched with i felt much more comfortable.,Well there was no counter on the video chat to show how long we were talking for so i feel i got lost in the conversation which isnt really a bad thing but still kind of frazzled. Also when i first joined and saw my chat mates face i kind of laughed to myself but good thing the camera wasnt enabled yet.,4.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,4.0,4.0,7.0,4.0,6.0,4.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,4.0,60.0,40.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,1.0,4.0,24.0,,,4.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,male,3.0,white,some_college,1.0,,12.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,20.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.875,6.0,2.0,2.3333333333333335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.6666666666666665,3.0,3.3333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,4.333333333333333,2.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,3.0,3.0,,
