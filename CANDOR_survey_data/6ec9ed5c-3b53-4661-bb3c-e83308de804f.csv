We talked more about Hawaii where he lived, which was fine because I found it more interesting than where I live anyway.",7.0,7.0,8.0,"We talked a little about the coronavirus and how it is affecting our areas. We also discussed a bit of travel and tourism and I told him about my trip to Germany 2 years ago. He again mentioned as earlier in the discussion that if I came to visit Hawaii, I would probably enjoy it, and we finished with a mutual aloha.",5.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,65.0,2.0,60.0,35.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,2.0,6.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,4.0,8.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,5.0,8.0,8.0,6.0,7.0,"I don't really see anything particularly out of the ordinary happening over the next week. I will be knitting some hats for veterans, taking my son's school project up to his school tomorrow, playing some games, exercising as much as posssible, and maybe helping my mom out with some things around the house, and possibly raiding her yarn for more to use for my own future projects. I'll probably talk to some friends and family on the phone, but overall I feel it will be a pretty normal week. My son has the last two days this week off school, so maybe we will try to find something fun to do those days, but I'm still not sure yet.","I think that the conversation was a pretty good icebreaker. I was a little nervous and awkward at the beginning and I think maybe he was too, a little unsure of what to say, but weather oddly enough is a common icebreaker because it's something we all have, so I think that kind of got the ball rolling. It isn't the most interesting subject but it can start the flow of conversation and then you move on to more interesting topics. I think we talked about a good variety of things in the time we had which made the time pass relatively quickly. I'd like to think that the things we talked about were enjoyable for both of us.","We ended up interrupting each other a few times, or in some cases simply tried to start speaking at the same time. This isn't the best thing to do in a conversation, although particularly when talking to a stranger, this is common, and even when talking with friends it tends to happen, so not that big a deal. We also moved pretty quickly from topic to topic, and I think this was for two reasons. For one thing we were trying to share, but not to be too personal, both because we were strangers and because this was a recorded study where it wouldn't be appropriate to give too much away. The other reason being that due to the time limit, I think we wanted to get in as much as we could in the time given, but this gave us less time to expand on each topic. I also believe that he was in a bit of a hurry because after the study he had to go to work, so we were trying to make sure we met the time goal but also didn't go too far over so he could get to work, and we still went 10 minutes over.",4.0,3.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,55.0,45.0,7.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,,2.0,,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,female,3.0,white,bachelors_degree,2.0,,7.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,36.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,6.0,2.0,2.3333333333333335,8.0,11.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,16.0,3.0,3.3333333333333335,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.6666666666666665,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.3333333333333335,,
