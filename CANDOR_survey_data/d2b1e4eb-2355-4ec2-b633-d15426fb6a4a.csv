And that we happened to be watching the same game before we came to this study. It was pretty funny. I told her where I was from and she did the same. She told me she was a Steelers fan and I was a Cowboys fan.,8.0,9.0,9.0,We talked about football mainly. With regards to how it is holding up with Covid. And how different it is without the fans or very minimal fans. We talked college football and NFL football. ,8.0,8.0,9.0,We still talked about Covid. This time in how it dealt with schools and the kids. She talked about her working in the school system and how it has affected her. We ended the conversation in talking about the Cowboys and the game I was about to watch.,9.0,8.0,8.0,9.0,8.0,7.0,7.0,9.0,70.0,6.0,60.0,70.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,1.0,8.0,8.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,8.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,8.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,9.0,9.0,8.0,9.0,8.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,8.0,9.0,I am watching football today. Some yardwork this evening. Tomorrow I will be going to work for the week. As well as going to my girlfriend's house to cook dinner together and watch some movies. We do this every week. I will also go visit my grandpa and give him some company.,We had a lot in common. Started right off with us being sports fans and the conversation took off from there. It all felt natural. She was warm and easy to talk to. The conversation never felt forced. I never ran out of stuff to say because we kept transitioning from one thing to another.,"I think I had to carry the conversation a little too much. My answers were longer because when I gave her the chance to talk, she seemed to be delayed in answering and did not elaborate as much as me. When this happens, I will talk longer because I know fi I don't, it could get some awkward silence.

We were both watching the Steelers/Eagles game so we could relate to liking the NFL. We were both familiar with how different major league sports and college sports programs are responding to COVID so we could share our thoughts.,I felt that my partner talked a lot. He did not ask many questions of me so I felt like I had to interject to be able to speak in the conversation.
