I expect to be quite busy with little time to do things I might want to do. I will make an effort to get in some exercise and spend some time outside and talk to my husband. ","I think that, despite our age differences, there were a few things that we had in common and that part of the conversation went pretty well. I think that we also related a bit over some shared college experiences and that we did not run out of topics. It was easy to keep things going.","My chat partner was much younger than me and she also seemed quite shy. I think that I drove much of the conversation and mainly asked her questions. Though she generally answered those questions well, she didn't ask me many questions and I didn't have many opportunities to speak about myself as a result. I also think she tuned me out or didn't attend well when I did talk about my life and didn't ask me any follow-up questions.",4.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,9.0,7.0,1.0,30.0,70.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,8.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,19.0,,,4.0,15.0,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,7.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,female,6.0,white,bachelors_degree,6.0,,8.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,56.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,1.6666666666666667,2.0,27.0,16.0,16.0,2.0,0.0,14.0,4.0,3.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,5.0,2.0,3.6666666666666665,3.0,3.3333333333333335,4.333333333333333,,

I have a lot to do, and I predict that I shall be burnt out and a little anxious. Depending on whether or not I get some specific tasks that will also affect my feelings of productiveness. If I am able to complete them I will feel good, and if not I will feel behind and continue to be stressed. ","She was polite and wanted to hear what I said. She also had a lot of life experience so she had lots of questions to ask, and had things to say herself. Since she was a teacher, I think she also had an idea of how to approach me and have me feel included as well as being kind. ","She had a strong personality, and although I am glad that the conversation was consistent and moved along, I wish that I had had more of an opportunity to ask her about herself and her life. I would have liked to know more about Japan for example. Secondly, I think the age difference made for a more uncomfortable dynamic because we felt we had to keep it more focused on very basic things like school, and I did not get to talk about musicians or the like. It just felt awkward. Perhaps her stating that I seemed shy perpetuated this as I became aware that I might not be an ideal conversational partner. Although I am aware of being awkward I usually am not told in the moment, and I can avoid thinking about it until later.
