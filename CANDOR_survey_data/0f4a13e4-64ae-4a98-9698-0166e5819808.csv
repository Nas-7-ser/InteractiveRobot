Part of that is having a commitment to getting things done, the other half is staying positive and balancing my energies (rest, relaxation, etc).   There's still a little over a day left in the week, so will have to push to make sure it's a good week.","We had a number of shared interests.   These would include learning foreign languages with duolingo, specifically spanish.  Also included traveling and going to italy, france.   Other shared interests included music and playing musical instruments, talking about differences between different musical instruments.  We discussed which languages had most difficult characters to learn, vs speaking.  Also had shared interest in some spanish language netflix shows.","I think for the most part it was good but there were some parts where we hit the end of a particular topic and we had to kind of work to get back into a flow.    There were also some parts where I basically had an awkward moment because I basically assumed that she was perhaps not from the US- which turned out to be correct but it was somewhat rude.  I was confused at time if this study was restricted to US or not, I know prolific is based in UK.  It didn't matter, we recovered and I didn't intend it that way but it was probably somewhat of a rude assumption.   She also started the conversation asking where I was from, which put me off a bit because usually people only ask where am I... not where I'm from.    She was younger than me too and was aware of that, so I think that might've caused some communication differences (particularly regarding the importance of where you are from).",9.0,9.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,7.0,7.0,3.0,60.0,40.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,7.0,8.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,8.0,,,4.0,8.0,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,male,3.0,white,some_college,1.0,,10.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,42.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.5,4.333333333333333,,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.6666666666666665,1.6666666666666667,4.0,1.0,4.666666666666667,3.6666666666666665,4.333333333333333,2.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,,

Maybe it was because the topics we chose to talk about were somewhat personal (like past experiences or things that make us unique) so we would naturally come to the end of a topic and move onto the next.,"At the very beginning, the conversation seemed really stale and bland. It felt pretty monotone on both ends, like we were search for what to speak of. But this only lasted for the first two minutes.
