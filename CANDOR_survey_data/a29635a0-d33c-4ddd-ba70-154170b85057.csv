As it just started, there's a lot to be looking forward too! My friend recently has been placed on lockdown again, so I'll be spending a lot of time hanging out with him. (digitally.) Otherwise, I have some work to do this week, but I really enjoy my side project! ","My conversation partner was very outgoing & didn't hold my fear/shyness against me. This being the first time I did something like this, It was nice that she was patient & treated my fairly. From what we discussed, we had quite a bit in common! It was nice meeting someone random & engaging with them! I was trying to suggest she play Minecraft with her whole family, as I believe the game could help them all find something that they would all enjoy.","Honestly, the only thing that didn't really work out well was me. I'm pretty shy, so this was a huge change of pace for me. It was a little stressful. I think I probably slowed the conversation down most of the time. Otherwise, she had some sort of alarm that would go off periodically, but it wasn't that bad.

Work-wise, I think I'll be productive, which is always a good thing. I plan on doing some fun activities with my kids, so that should be fun. We don't have a lot of set things we have to do, so it is pretty laid back. ","When we found some common areas to discuss, it seemed to go a little better. Talking about his dog and the video games he likes to play made him more talkative. I tried to adjust and relate as much as I could, which I do think he appreciated. We laughed some. ",There was a little awkwardness with the discussion of 1st-person shooter games and with Bouvier dogs being smarter than shepherds. Totally fine - just a little awkward. I felt like I had to carry the conversation a little more. He was definitely shy and a bit uncomfortable.
