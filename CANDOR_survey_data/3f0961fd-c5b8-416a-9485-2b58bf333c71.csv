My dad had a heart attack and is coming home from rehab on Friday; my mom is terrified because he's a large man but physically weak, and she can't help him get up if he falls, which he tends to do. Earlier this year I spent about a month living at their house to watch over him, and I don't mind it except my mom is one of those covid deniers and she blithely goes out for haircuts and pedicures and restaurants and other places and it's not fair to me. But maybe she'll get a nurse or something. Now that I've written all this I'm depressed!","He was friendly and open and responsive to whatever I asked about. We're both musicians, so we had that to talk about. We could also talk about gaming, which I do a lot, and California, where I lived for about 20 years, and I'm very familiar with Berkeley, where he'll be going to college.","He's young, not especially socially experienced, and it felt like if I didn't ask a question or bring up a topic, we would have sat there staring at each other.
