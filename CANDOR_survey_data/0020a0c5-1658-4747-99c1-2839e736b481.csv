I'm feeling a bit ill today and it's only been getting worse. I'm not sure if I'll be able to make it into work, which is very unlike me, due to me feeling sick, and fearing spreading covid to my coworkers. And if I get tested, I have to miss work until my results are in.","I think the fact we were both from the midwest, and had a bit of an understanding of the weather. I think we share interests, in halloween, craft beer, etc., so that helped make the conversation go smoothly.  I think the fact that we both liked to share our experiences was very helpful as well.","I think the fact that we both like to talk, it was hard not to talk over one another so that was slightly problematic, although nothing too major. I could just tell that sometimes when I was talking, she would be wanting to and vice versa, but overall I don't think it was a major issue.",5.0,5.0,7.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,8.0,8.0,7.0,40.0,60.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,6.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,3.0,3.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,4.0,5.0,,1.0,3.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,3.0,4.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,male,3.0,white,completed_high_school,1.0,,8.0,6.5,2.0,,False,,,34.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.125,6.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.3333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,4.0,4.0,3.6666666666666665,4.333333333333333,4.0,4.666666666666667,3.0,4.666666666666667,,

Outside of one issue at work that is proving to be somewhat frustrating, I can see the rest of my week being a good mix of baking for other people, spending time with my partner and enjoying some movies and craft time. Not a bad way to spend a week! ","I think our conversation seemed to flow really well. I do worry about if I talked too much... I have a tendency to do that when I'm nervous, but my conversation partner was so nice and friendly that our chat ended up being a nice highlight of my week! It was a really nice visit. ","Like I mentioned before, I do worry that perhaps I talked too much. I do tend to be chatty when I'm nervous, but I don't think that it bothered him too much. I also was worried I was asking too many personal questions (again, me being a nervous chatter) so I hope my chat partner felt comfortable.
