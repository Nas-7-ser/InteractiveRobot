Studying will help me work on my career and spending time with my daughter will allow me to bond with her and prepare her for the school year!,"I think my conversation partner and I both were open-minded and respectful, especially in dialogue. We listened and agreed, and shared. We had some things in common and were able to relate to each other. He and I additionally were both proactive in talking to each other, which worked well.","I didn't feel anything didn't work well in the conversation because overall was very positive and natural, or a normal type of conversation. I guess we could've dug deeper; however, it's understandable how just meeting someone and with the time allotted light conversation could be better or more conducive. This set-up could lend itself to casual conversation or exchange!",2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,50.0,50.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,8.0,9.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,,2.0,,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,female,3.0,asian,bachelors_degree,1.0,,8.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,45.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6.375,6.0,,1.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,

If I see it going as good, it tends to be more good even if/when I have struggles or unexpected events happen.    So I try to do everything I can do to make every day as positive and accomplished as I can.  Sometimes better than others.","She was very, very committed to being nice and friendly and making a connection.   She was always affirming and relating and it was not high effort to keep it going.  I almost feel like we both sort of agreed to go significantly over the limit just in the spirit of being overly polite or because it was going well enough we could.","While the conversation wasn't hard, I wasn't very stimulated or engaged.  I felt like we mostly discussed surface-level things and avoided really listening or trying to learn anything.   It was very polite and friendly, but there was no depth.   I am a private person so I don't usually reveal a lot, but you can still have a good and sort of meaningful conversation without sharing anything super personal.... but i think we were more committed to just sort of filling the space with trivialities.   It wasn't bad, she did sort of remind me of an ex girlfriend in this way though.    Just because somebody is easy to talk to, doesn't mean it's fulfilling.
