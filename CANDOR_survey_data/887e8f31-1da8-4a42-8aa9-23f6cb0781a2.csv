My partner is having significant relationship trouble with her husband (we're polyamorous), and I'm trying to support her through those struggles. It's really sad and stressful. I've also been having a difficult time with my sleep schedule, and am struggling to get restful, unbroken sleep. That's been frustrating for me. So I think I'm going to have to put quite a bit of energy into both of those things.","I feel like we were both able to listen actively to one another, and bring curiosity to the conversation. It didn't feel forced. I felt like we were figuring out how to ""do"" the conversation together in the context of the experiment, so it felt like we were working together to navigate something new. We also established common ground quickly (interest in heavy metal, pets, public health).","It was a bit hard to learn what one another's values were without any previous material to go on. Sometimes I tried to be quiet to let her have the floor, and it felt like she had a harder time finding a way to push the conversation forward. It was hard to get a sense of positive eye contact or connection with her over video chat, because you can't look at the screen and into the camera at the same time.",6.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,9.0,9.0,4.0,65.0,35.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,8.0,8.0,6.0,2.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,4.0,20.0,,,4.0,25.0,,,5.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,,other_or_prefer_not_to_answer,6.0,white,bachelors_degree,3.0,,6.0,10.0,2.0,,False,,,39.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.25,6.333333333333333,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,4.333333333333333,4.0,3.3333333333333335,5.0,2.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,2.3333333333333335,4.0,,

I feel like I am on standby, so it is hard to move forward into the unknown. ",I got matched with someone that was extremely agreeable. He was very easy to talk to and we had quite a few things in common. We actually talked beyond the time limit because we got along so well. We seemed to have the same interests and same views on things happening in the world. ,"I think that it was kind of awkward to just jump into a conversation with a complete stranger. There were no prompts given to us, so we had to figure out what to talk about. I think we both were really interested in the topics we discussed and sometimes we jumped into the conversations and spoke over one another or cut each other because we were excited.
