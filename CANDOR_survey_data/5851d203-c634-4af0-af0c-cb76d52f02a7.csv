Spring is here and I'm going to go for a long hike today and a run tomorrow. I'll catch up on some paperwork and call family. I'll have some good food - maybe ice cream today! - and watch a movie. I'll spend time with my husband. I love weekends...,"We were able to talk about enough experiences we share and can relate to so that we could keep the conversation going without being all COVID all the time. It was fun to share notes on Prolific and similar platforms. Also it was cool that we are both in Massachusetts, were born in NY, know UMass Amherst, etc.","We had a few moment of struggling with what to talk about. I wouldn't say the conversation dragged, but there were some periods that weren't as interesting as others. I don't think we went particularly deep; it was more of a chit-chat conversation than really getting to know each other.",4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,7.0,7.0,3.0,55.0,45.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,7.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,20.0,,,4.0,20.0,,,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,female,6.0,white,masters_degree,1.0,,8.0,7.5,2.0,,False,,,56.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.5,6.0,,1.6666666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.3333333333333335,4.0,2.6666666666666665,2.3333333333333335,4.666666666666667,2.3333333333333335,4.333333333333333,4.0,3.0,3.3333333333333335,,

I'm looking forward to watching more of my show and hopefully finishing the season I'm on. But other than that I have also been learning more about finance online so I hope that will be fun. ,"There were many things that worked well in the conversation. First off, we both started by introducing ourselves and stated where we were from. From there we found some things in common between us like we are both in Massachusetts, and used that to start the conversation. We both also wanted to converse and discuss whatever topic we chose so that worked pretty well.",There wasn't really anything that did not work. The only thing I would say was that we struggled a little bit to find a topic to discuss but once we did our conversation flowed from there.
