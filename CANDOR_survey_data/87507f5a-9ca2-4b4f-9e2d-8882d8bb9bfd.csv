Well tomorrow I'll probably get up and go hunting so that will be a nice start to the day. Saturday I've got to work but I work at a brewery so I can't complaint. Sunday I have to go to Best Buy to finally pick up a new fridge and I really don't know what will happen in the rest of the week that follows but overall things look to be going well!,We both have/had dogs so we had something in common there and could connect and relate to each other about some of the issues related to dog ownership and the challenges that it can present. We're also both experiencing the pandemic so we were able to relate to each other there as well.,There was an age difference that made it difficult and we really did not have that much in common. I felt like I had to lead a lot of the conversation to get to the 25 minute mark but I guess sometimes that's just how it is.
