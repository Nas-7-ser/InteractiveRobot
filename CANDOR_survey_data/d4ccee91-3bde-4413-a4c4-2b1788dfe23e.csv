I have developed a routine of waking up, personal grooming, workout, breakfast, then taking a walk. So I will stick to that routine until quarantine is lifted. Thursday is going to be exception because I commute to work at the courthouse. The rest of the week I am working remotely at home under quarantine. ",I really enjoyed the open mindedness of my conversation partner. We were able to use  each other's dialogue to move quickly to the next topic. We waited patiently for each other to finish speaking before replying. We had similarities and differences yet showed respect and dignity to our different lifestyles and living situations. ,"The conversation partner had two dogs who kept popping the frame or snoring or barking or running around on floor. She was trying to keep them under control but they were a bit uncooperative and as she was chiding them to get off the bed, stop growling or get into the kennel, that led to a break in the flow of the conversation.

The weather is starting to improve in my area (we had snow the other day!) so I'll be able to get out more. I have a job that I love, that I am able to do remotely. I feel optimistic that things will get a little better in our country every day. ","One of the things that worked well is that we both listened carefully and stayed focused on what our partner was saying. We are also from different parts of the country, different ages, and have different jobs so that gave us a lot to talk about. We are both agreeable and friendly people, so that made the conversation very easy and enjoyable. ","The only thing that didn't work well was that my dog started barking and interrupted Ray a few times. That made me feel bad, but I handled it as adeptly as I could. Other than that, there was not an unpleasant aspect to the conversation from my end, but from Ray's end there was a dog barking a few times.
