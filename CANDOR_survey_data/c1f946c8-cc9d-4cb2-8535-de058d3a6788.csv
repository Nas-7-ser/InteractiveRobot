Since I don't really have anything else like this lined up, I would say that my week will be less fun. I hope I find another chance to do this again, because like I said, it was probably the highlight of my week so far. Not that I thin the rest of my week will be terrible, I just really enjoyed the conversation today.","I think that for one thing, we had a lot in common, and we were able to talk about similar situations we had. We had fun bouncing stories of similar experiences off each other. We actually were strikingly similar; we even kind of looked alike. (I hate to think of what HE might think of that!) Despite the (few) differences we had, we were able to have a fun, adult conversation on a few topics.","I really can't pinpoint something that didn't go well. My partner uttered a couple of profanities, but that did not bother me in the slightest, but seemed to bother him at first as though he sort of forgot himself. I was not offended at all, and maybe took three seconds to reassure him that he should allow himself his full range of expression. He seems more at ease at that point. It was really nothing, and we were able to continue as if nothing had really happened. And I cannot stress enough, it was fine.",6.0,5.0,7.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,45.0,55.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,1.0,5.0,,2.0,,4.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,male,3.0,white,some_college,2.0,,8.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,50.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.125,6.0,,1.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,3.3333333333333335,2.0,3.3333333333333335,4.333333333333333,3.6666666666666665,4.666666666666667,3.3333333333333335,1.6666666666666667,4.333333333333333,,

I'll be also practicing making a website and possibly making more music as well.  I'll be looking for more work from home opportunities to help mine and my families situation and I'll keep in touch with friends and familly via skype/zoom and phone conversations.,I think the conversation worked well because Eric and I were both open minded about where the conversation could go.  We touched base on our common ground which was being on proflic and doing surveys and then from that expanded the conversation. Eric was willing to engage with me on every topic that was brought up and add insights as well.  ,"Besides quality of our webcams, everything went relatively well.  I was able to hear Erick well, I hope he was able to hear me well too.  It seemed technically everything was working well enough to continue our conversation for as long as it went.  Besides any small technical situations, I think the conversation went well.
