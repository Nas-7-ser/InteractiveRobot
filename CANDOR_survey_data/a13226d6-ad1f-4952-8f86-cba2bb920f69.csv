In addition, I may see a few friends over the weekend so I am excited about it.","Due to COVID-19 and a lot of the effects that the pandemic has caused, I feel that conversations around these topics worked well. We were able to talk about how the pandemic has affected us, our well-beings, and our loved ones. In addition, we were able to talk about the impact on travel and our jobs due to COVID-19.","There were times where I had a little difficultly hearing my partner's voice because he couldn't find his microphone on the laptop. He had to move around the laptop in order for me to hear.

Having a global pandemic which most people have never seen is definitely a subject matter that people have thoughts, opinions, and stories on. Additionally it has impacted basically everyone's life so people have a personal experience to share in regards to the current global situation. ",We didn't talk much about personal interests which is a great way to really develop a connection with someone. It basically felt like we were trying to keep the ball rolling as much as possible just to make sure we hit the 25 minute time minimum. It was cool to get the COVID perspective of a person who lives in a much different area though. ,6.0,4.0,9.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,7.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,35.0,65.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,8.0,9.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,4.0,13.0,,,4.0,13.0,,,3.0,5.0,3.0,7.0,6.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,7.0,8.0,7.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,male,2.0,white,bachelors_degree,1.0,,7.0,6.0,2.0,,False,,,34.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.75,6.333333333333333,1.0,1.6666666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,4.0,1.6666666666666667,4.666666666666667,5.0,3.6666666666666665,2.6666666666666665,4.0,,
