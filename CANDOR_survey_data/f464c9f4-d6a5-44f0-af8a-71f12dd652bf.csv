I have friends coming this weekend from out of town, and I would say this conversation got me excited for their arrival.  I also start a new job on Monday, and I think this conversation got me excited to get started and get back into my work mode.","I think he asked some interesting and very intelligent questions, but I didn't get a chance to learn much about him. I tried a few times to ask some questions, but since he seemed interested in my job, I didnt push asking questions and I began answering the questions he had.","I wish I was able to ask more questions about him and learn about his life and his environment.  Living on the other side of the country, I'm sure I could have learned more from him sharing his life experiences and his every day.

I also plan on applying to a couple jobs to see what I can find to be able to stand on my own two feet financially.,"My partner seemed very knowledgeable about his work and his industry so I took the opportunity to ask him questions I had about regulations, taxes, etc. If the conversation were taken to be an interview instead, I think my partner and I did a good job. He was able to teach me a lot about his work.","As I said before, it felt like an interview instead of a conversation, but I enjoyed it as it was. I did not speak as much as he did, but I do not see it as a problem because I really enjoyed what he had to say. We also didn't have too much in common besides graduating at bad times.
