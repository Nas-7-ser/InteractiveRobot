Waking up and going riht to my office to start working and to get on calls. I want to do more with my childern after work as well, so playing outside more would be nice. ","We had alot in common when it came to childern. She had four childern, all girls, and I can relate to her on that. It is amazing how quickly people can come together when they start talking about their childern. She was also very humble about her childern and what she does with them. ","While I was able to relate to her about childern, I couldnt relate to her as much about some of her other topics such as having childern young and having to deal with a family member influence the health of the baby who was born addicted.
