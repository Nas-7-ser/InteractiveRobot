Not very close, but he did not take over the whole thing and he seemed less relaxed than most of the woman have been, but he loosened up. I think we agreed on a lot and that helped. ",There was some awkwardness as I tried to not interrupt and be a better listener. IT was awkward for him too since I told him I was doing it.

This made it pretty easy for me to keep the conversation going despite the fact I am by no stretch of the imagination someone who usually does pretty well with communication.  She was easily able to continue the conversation by bringing up whatever personal/academic examples.,"Although it mostly went well, the things I struggled with were my partner was generally hard to find an opening with in the conversation and her webcam was not angled well, so I couldn't see her well to be able to read her gestures much.
