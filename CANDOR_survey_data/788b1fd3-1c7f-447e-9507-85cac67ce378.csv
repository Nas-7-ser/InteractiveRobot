To be honest, I'm in some pain right now which is likely clouding that judgement. I got a filling today and I'm experiencing some toothache which likely isn't a good sign. Other than that, I've just got a lot of schoolwork on my mind, so I'm looking to finish that up. Taking these last classes of high school online isn't how I imagined my senior year, so it's somewhat more of a bitter end than I would've preferred.","I think the fact that we didn't have a lot in common — but that the pandemic is affecting everybody — lent itself well to a nice conversation. We were able to use that as a jumping-off point, and then stretch into each of our lives first through the lens of how we were affected by COVID, and then what we were like before (and what we'd like our lives to be like after) the virus hit.","Not a whole lot didn't work. We generally had a nice conversation. I think that maybe the only things that seemed to bring a lull were that we didn't have any specific instructions and twenty-five minutes can be difficult to fill with a stranger — especially when you're not in-person. Camera/non-physical interactions come to me a lot less naturally, and so there were a few moments where we had a moment of awkward silence, but nothing too noticeable.",3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,4.0,6.0,7.0,3.0,42.0,58.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,6.0,6.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,4.0,6.0,4.0,19.0,,,4.0,18.0,,,5.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,male,4.0,white,completed_high_school,2.0,,8.0,5.0,2.0,,False,,,19.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.125,5.333333333333333,,1.6666666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.6666666666666665,4.666666666666667,3.3333333333333335,2.3333333333333335,4.666666666666667,2.6666666666666665,4.0,4.333333333333333,3.0,2.6666666666666665,,

There was genuine interest on both ends.  There were no awkward moments nor moments of silence.  We asked each other questions about various things going on in our perspective lives and they felt genuine.  My partner was very interesting which made the conversation very satisfying.,There was not anything that did not work well.
