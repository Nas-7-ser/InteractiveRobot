I am looking forward to connecting with friends that I have not seen in a long time and establish personal contacts that I have been missing for months. ,"On the surface, we had some difference but were quickly able to identify common beliefs and core values. The conversation was extremely enjoyable and gave me a good feeling about connecting with a human which has been difficult during Covid. Elaine was intelligent, thoughtful and empathetic. We went 20 minutes past our required time because it was so enjoyable and even connected on social media so we could stay in touch.  ","Not really any issues, there were a couple of times the screen froze but we were still able to communicate verbally and it only froze briefly. I have no complaints about the interaction we had. We were able to discuss our similarities and differences with compassion and interest. There were really no difficulties in the conversation. It flowed freely and I think gave both of us a pleasant experience.

I have made great headway on some work projects as well as some personal projects. I am moving in with my partner over the weekend so I may feel a bit anxious surrounding time but overall I see the remainder of the week going smoothly. ,"We began the conversation on a very friendly note. Both of us were smiling and neither one of us seemed to be too nervous. We immediately found that we had so much in common. My conversation partner was also really bold about the topics they brought up, but I am the same way. I am always ready to dive deep into conversation with other people. Life is such a collective and individual experience and we had all the same beliefs and values. So basically what worked well was that we already had similar views. ","I think at the beginning we were both very aware of the time. I know I kept looking at it cause once we started talking, I realized that 25 minutes of talking to a stranger is actually quite challenging unless you vibe fairly quickly. Chatting with a stranger in public is different. You don't HAVE to talk to them and can dip when the conversation has run it's course. We got quite personal and I think that's the only way to flesh out that amount of time with a stranger. I don't necessarily consider this ""not working"" but I would have prepared some kind of outline of what to talk about to avoid getting so personal with a stranger online.
