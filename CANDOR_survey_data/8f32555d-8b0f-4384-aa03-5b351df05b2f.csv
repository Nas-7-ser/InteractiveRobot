He was in high spirits and was actually interested in what I did. So much so that I didn't even get a chance to talk to him about himself more, and I wish I did! Our similarities in things really worked well because we had a lot more in common than I would have expected. Considering he's a man probably in his 30s with 2 kids.","Probably the only thing that didn't work well in my opinion was that he asked so much about me, I barely had time to ask him stuff.

The fact that she was studying for her CFP was a comfort for me as I was able to talk finance with her (a comfort level for me). Also talking about where she lived and Charlotte made the convo very easy to digest as well. ,"There were times when I felt that she wanted to either end the conversation or didnt really want to expand on what I was asking her on.
