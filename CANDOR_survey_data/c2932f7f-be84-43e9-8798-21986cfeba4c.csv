However, I am looking forward to preparing for the holidays.","I think I worked well for the conversation. I don’t want to be rude but we had nothing in common so, I kept trying to find things to talk about. She was very specific and didn’t want to go into details. Thus it made the conversation very hard and mechanical.","I think the age difference was a problem. I guess we couldn’t find something that we could engage in that would be substantial. Nevertheless, she was close minded. Meaning she didn’t want to give to much of herself to a stanger.

She mentioned that at the time, she was in college and her friends had cars, but she did not. She reminisced about long boots and short miniskirts that she wore back then and that there were tunnels between the dorms at the college she went to. She asked about if I go to online school or if I take my classes in person, what my major was and what lead me to choose it. ",8.0,7.0,7.0,"Towards the end of the conversation, we talked about her name and what it meant. I asked her if she was comfortable with sharing her name and then she said it didn't have a name, but her granddad wrote her first name on a piece of toilet paper and told her mom ""this is what you will name her"". We also talked about how she had a headache beforehand but she was feeling better, and that after the conversation she would likely go get some work done. 2 minutes before the call ended, I requested that she and I chat for another minute because I had joined the call at 8:01 and it was only 8:25 at the time. Before the call ended, we said it was nice to meet each other and I encouraged her to take her to take all the time she needed, and I mentioned that I was sure that she gave her own name meaning and she said that her life the past 10 years is largely a blessing so she would say that her name means blessing.

In the 'memory of beginning of the conversation"" portion, I forgot to mention how she talked about her daughter and her daughter's dedication to letting everyone know what she wanted for Christmas (downloaded apps to tell Santas, told her mom, dad and grandmother on the mom's side and the dad's side), and that she loved and impressed by her daughter's gratitude and humbleness for even for the little things. She also mentioned that Christmas was her favorite holiday (I realize that this is the wrong section to type this in but she was very thorough and passionate about it, so although this is typed at a later section that I should have typed it in, this is an ode to that memory.
