I plan on seeing my boyfriend and playing some video games. I would also like to finish all of my schoolwork so I can finish my semester completely. I would like to see myself finish with straight A's. I also plan on spending time with my family. ,"I think the fact that we had a lot in common helped us come up with things to talk about. We both are college students, in our twenties, and both watch Netflix. Also, we both are in relationships. We were able to talk about television shows, schoolwork, and how we were dealing with the pandemic. ","Everything went well in the conversation. At first, we had trouble thinking about what to talk about, but with every question asked, we came up with even more to discuss since we had so much to learn about each other. For intense, when she mentioned television shows we started talking about shows we liked.

I think that it will be productive though because I am forced to get a lot done. I am hopeful about what I will be able to get done. I am excited about starting up some research projects I have planned.,"I think we had some things in common and we were both happy that we weren't paired with an old creep man. We were both in school and were able to bond over our experiences with zoom classes, virtual classes, school work, etc. She was also from New York and I went to undergrad in CT. Additionally, I am in South Carolina now and she told me that she comes here yearly with her family. We also talked about shows we're watching so that was good. I think the conversation flowed well for the most part even though it was an awkward situation.","I can't think of too many things, to be honest. I think I could've maybe been more energetic to match her personality, but I'm pretty tired and I also don't have the most bubbly personality. But she was really cool and seemed enthusiastic. Maybe we could've had more conversation topics to make the conversation more exciting than it was, but I think it was fine.",8.0,6.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,40.0,60.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,6.0,6.0,9.0,9.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,3.0,9.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,,,female,6.0,black_or_african_american,bachelors_degree,7.0,Student (on a fully funded graduate research fellowship) - so in school but also being paid for it? ,7.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,24.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.5,4.666666666666667,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.666666666666667,2.3333333333333335,4.333333333333333,4.666666666666667,3.0,2.6666666666666665,4.333333333333333,,
