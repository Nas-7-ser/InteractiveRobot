",7.0,7.0,6.0,"We talked about the weather in our respective states. He said it gets below 0 degrees where he's at and that after he remodeled his garage, it was still very cold. He said his garage was a place for his kids to hang out.",7.0,7.0,7.0,We talked about the survey sites like mturk. He said he was banned from mturk to which I replied that I was as well.

",What worked is that we both liked drinking beer and seemed to have a similar sense of humor. We both were working adults who owned property and agreed on the fact that taxation is theft. We also agreed on the fact that the city is not the best place to live.,What didn't work so well was that we seemed to be in different stages of our lives.
