I am going to work tomorrow. I will be getting a new cable for my cord in a couple of days. I am making 425 from a laundry study next week as long as we don't go into shutdown next week. I will be going and getting my money soon.,I think the man I spoke with was very outgoing and he was willing to carry the conversation when it was going to lag. He also was very intelligent and had a long of good things to say about what was going on. I think he was very capable as well.,The internet was lagging somewhat. I also think that I might have interjected a couple of time at the wrong moment. I think that also having a set amount of time that I must talk also maybe the conversation feel a little forced at times when it would have went more smoothly at other times.,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,9.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,5.0,50.0,50.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,9.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,3.0,,,5.0,,1.0,1.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,female,2.0,white,bachelors_degree,1.0,,6.0,6.0,2.0,,False,,,44.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,1.0,2.0,7.0,7.0,1.6666666666666667,1.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.666666666666667,3.3333333333333335,5.0,1.6666666666666667,3.0,4.333333333333333,4.0,4.333333333333333,2.3333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,,

Neither of us seemed to have a ton of things in common off the start but she was really friendly and easy to talk to. It also helped that with the current events happening now, it wasn't exactly difficult to find topics to talk about.","The only part that was a little bumpy in the conversation was at the very beginning. In fairness, I don't know how easy it ever is to instantly strike up a conversation with a stranger but it took a minute to settle into a comfortable conversation.
