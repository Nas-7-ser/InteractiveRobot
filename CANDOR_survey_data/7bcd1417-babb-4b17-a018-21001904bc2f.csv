I am going to be streaming some games online. I'll also be working on my website and trying to grow an audience. I hope things continue to grow and I break new records in my attempt to grow my community. I will also have to go shopping for my ex later this week.,"Well, they seemed to be nice. We both had decent stories and strange things to discuss. I liked her positivity and general demeanor. I get the feeling she's a nice person. I hope things were mutual. I feel we went longer than expected due to enjoying talking. So, in the end, I hope both our days are better as a result.",The video quality on her end seemed to drop a few times. Occasionally there seemed to be an audio delay and we spoke over each other. Not knowing each other was a barrier at the very beginning and I felt awkward but overall I think things went well all things considered.,5.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,3.0,7.0,5.0,7.0,3.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,8.0,5.0,60.0,40.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,9.0,3.0,2.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,5.0,4.0,25.0,,,5.0,6.0,5.0,7.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,3.0,8.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,male,3.0,white,some_college,1.0,,8.0,6.0,2.0,,False,,,33.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.25,5.666666666666667,,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,2.3333333333333335,4.333333333333333,3.3333333333333335,4.0,4.0,4.333333333333333,1.0,4.333333333333333,,

I am having a good day so far since my partner showed up this time and the fact that we had a decent conversation. I am also less stressed about work this week since I am going on vacation as of Sunday.,"I think what worked well is the fact that we found stories to talk about that took a couple minutes to describe. I can imagine if we were asking questions back and forth, time would go more slowly. It also worked well that we were able to share stories similar to each other's.","I think what didn't work well was our sense of humour. We don't know each other so we don't know what the other finds funny or won't find offensive. I also would have preferred to have deeper, more meaningful conversations than to have small talk or talk about random things.",3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,8.0,8.0,4.0,50.0,50.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,8.0,8.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,25.0,,,5.0,,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,female,4.0,hispanic_or_latino,bachelors_degree,1.0,,6.0,9.0,2.0,,False,,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.75,5.333333333333333,,1.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.6666666666666665,4.0,4.666666666666667,3.0,3.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,2.0,2.3333333333333335,3.0,3.3333333333333335,,
