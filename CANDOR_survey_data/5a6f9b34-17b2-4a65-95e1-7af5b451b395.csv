I work from home so that isn't so much of an issue but it can get a little frustrating or boring. I will likely spend most of my time at my computer or relaxing listening to audiobooks.",I believe that we both found it easy to talk to eachother. I imagine that part of it was that we both seemed to have an interest in travel so it was easy to talk about that and discuss some of the places that we've been. Our conversation was fluid enough that I didn't really think about the time passing.,There isn't really much to say here; there weren't any parts that come to mind that I feel didn't work out conversationally. We spoke for a lot longer than the expected length of time which goes toward the notion that we didn't find any issues in conversing with eachother.

Also it won't rain for the next two days, and that will be help with fewer days indoor.","Ian had a lot of variety in his life that was not common so there was a lot to talk about. We were both fans of traveling, and could relate different places to each other. I also didn't know a lot of what he was talking about so it was like learning. ","At first I was worried he would talk the whole time, and I would just be talked at rather than with.
