It will be a long weekend and I am going camping with my boyfriend and our roommate. I am excited to get to relax and spend some time in the woods. ",We found a common interest (gardening) and were able to talk about it for a lot of the conversation. We also found several other thing that we have in common or have both experienced and being able to talk about those worked well. I think we were both attentive and responding to what the other person said. ,"Occasionally the conversation felt a little stilted and didn't flow as well as it could have because we don't know very much about each other. Also, because I was talking with a total stranger on the internet, I was a little reticent to give away too many personal details or get involved in any potentially controversial topics.

The children are going away for the weekend with my wife's sister so the wife and I will get some time together to enjoy our garden and our dogs, and we should be able to watch some fireworks from our house in the country without having to go anywhere and risk our health.","We had a lot in common, since my chat partner also visited Portland Oregon and enjoyed the kombucha there where my daughter went to college. So we had a lot of the saame impressions about the beauty of Portland and its natural lifestyle. We also are both in the process of growing gardens and so were able to share some gardening tips and successes and failures. We also both love dogs and each have dogs so it worked out to be a great conversation with so much we had in common to talk about, there really was no silent or awkward pauses. ","My chat partner was a good listener as well as a good speaker but occasionally talked a bit nonstop to catch up to. I really wanted to know more about her dogs or see her dog on the screen but she changed topics and was on to other things and ideas with her high energy personality, and she seemed a little bit nervous but kept talking and friendly in order to overcome it.",4.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,3.0,6.0,4.0,7.0,5.0,3.0,7.0,5.0,8.0,8.0,5.0,40.0,60.0,7.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,9.0,9.0,6.0,5.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,2.0,4.0,20.0,,,6.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,male,4.0,white,some_college,7.0,self employed,8.0,9.0,2.0,,False,,,56.0,15.0,,30.0,30.0,30.0,0.0,10.0,60.0,10.0,20.0,10.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,6.25,6.333333333333333,2.3333333333333335,1.6666666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.6666666666666665,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.333333333333333,4.333333333333333,3.6666666666666665,2.6666666666666665,4.0,family,in_person
