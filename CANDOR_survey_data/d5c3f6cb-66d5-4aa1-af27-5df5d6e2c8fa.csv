I will put attention to taking dare of myself and doing things that I like to rest. I'm going to keep it calm since I've done lots of activities this week that make me anxious, including this live conversation today.",What worked well is that we had a lot of things in common including true crime and psychology. We were also from a liberal area of California and I find that does make a difference in terms of being able to relate to one another. I felt decently comfortable with her. ,"My partner was at least twelve years younger than me and very visibly a bit anxious. Her anxiety was making me a bit nervous since I do pick up on others' emotions. I felt like she was worried about being presentable and she couldn't quite be herself. That comes with age, but it does effect the quality of conversation.

I'm excited to not have to do volunteering for the weekend because it stresses me out to make phone calls, and I'll get a couple of nice days to just be by myself and reflect. I hope that I don't end up in a weird mood again though.",It was nice that we both had interest in true crime and we both studied psychology. I got some really great podcast and documentary recommendations and I was able to give her some as well. She also had a really cute dog that I got to see so that was great.,"I think we were both really awkward. We're both introverted weird people and sometimes that works really well for stranger interactions because we can relate to each other, but in this case conversation didn't flow as well as the other conversations I have done for this study.
