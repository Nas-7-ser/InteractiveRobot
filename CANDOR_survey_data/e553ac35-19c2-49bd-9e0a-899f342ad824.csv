I don't have to work or think about work and I get to relax and do the things that I want to do. I am also going to be watching scary movies with friends. ,We were both genuinely engaged and interested in each other. We asked questions of the other person and engaged and followed-up. We were both able to contribute to the conversation and lead it while also letting the other person take the time to talk. He was also great at keeping up the conversation.,Sometimes we accidentally talked over each other but I think that was a sound issue maybe due to his headset. Sometimes I wasn't sure if he heard me or if iI should repeat myself but other than that everything went very well and the conversation was fun to have and engage in.,1.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,50.0,50.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,2.0,5.0,,1.0,2.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,female,4.0,black_or_african_american,masters_degree,1.0,,6.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,30.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.5,6.0,,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.6666666666666665,4.333333333333333,4.333333333333333,3.0,4.333333333333333,3.0,4.0,3.3333333333333335,3.0,3.0,,

I have met some people at a time when it has been less common for me to have done so. I could say if it wasn't for covid I would have these situations more often but the truth of the matter is I don't go out of my way to talk to people. I know these are somewhat forced situations where we are told to interact but I feel relaxed with the idea of talking to someone in person more than I did before. I'm interested in the next person I get to meet but also a bit sad.,"The person was pretty attentive, young, and open-minded. She had a personality and a warm smile that would put anyone at ease. Talking to her was fairly easy and we did share some common ground that made it easier to connect and establish talking points. I was pretty interested in what she had to say.","I know it sounds a bit silly but I have talked to 4 others before her and we all went over the time cause I couldn't stop talking to them. The only thing that I would point out as less favorable was I feel rushed to cover a broad amount of topics past the ""hello my name is"" ""I live here"" part of the conversation. I was only getting warmed up and it was time to say goodbye. I did get the impression she wasn't feeling me as much as I was her.",6.0,6.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,60.0,40.0,6.0,3.0,1.0,6.0,5.0,7.0,8.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,7.0,5.0,,1.0,4.0,5.0,,2.0,,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,male,4.0,white,completed_high_school,2.0,,6.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,31.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,5.333333333333333,,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,4.666666666666667,4.666666666666667,2.6666666666666665,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.3333333333333335,2.3333333333333335,4.0,,
