I also am looking forward to organizing and getting rid of things in the house that we dont need and maybe starting a new project or two.,"I think that we were similar and could relate to each other because of those similarities.

She was very interested in everything I was talking about and asked a lot of questions which made it very easy to keep the conversation moving. ",It's honestly hard to come up with much. Early on she was a little unsure on how to proceed. We also interrupted each other talking a few times (sometimes I couldn't tell she was talking because the video glitched). I don't like interrupting people so I felt bad that I did interrupt her a few times.
