We both had pets and she likes animals, so I knew that she was a person that I would like. She also has an autistic son and I'm a behavioral therapist, so I knew that would make us click. There was an age difference and we are different races, but we did briefly talk about the struggles of being a woman in tech. She was awesome.","Honestly, I don't really think anything didn't work well. We both talked a lot and shared parts of our story with each other. We laughed a lot.
