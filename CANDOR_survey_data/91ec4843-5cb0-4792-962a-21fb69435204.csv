I plan to apply for lots of jobs and hopefully get an interview. I am also looking forward to starting season 14 of Big Brother. It is supposed to be a great season and I have never seen it before. I am optimistic about my week.,My conversation partner was very friendly. He asked me lots of questions and kept the conversation going. He didn't shoot down anything I said or make me feel insecure or stupid. He was very nice and forthcoming about stuff in his life when I asked him about it. I would talk to him again.,I feel that my conversation partner and I didn't have that much in common. I also found it difficult to get a word in sometimes because he asked a lot of questions and talked a lot. I also did not understand what he was talking about some of the time.,1.0,4.0,8.0,1.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,8.0,8.0,9.0,50.0,50.0,7.0,1.0,4.0,7.0,7.0,9.0,9.0,7.0,4.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,,1.0,3.0,4.0,18.0,,,1.0,3.0,5.0,7.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,7.0,6.0,8.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,female,6.0,white,bachelors_degree,2.0,,9.0,9.0,2.0,,False,,,22.0,6.0,,0.0,80.0,20.0,0.0,0.0,80.0,0.0,0.0,20.0,0.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,6.0,30.0,1.0,,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.625,6.333333333333333,1.6666666666666667,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.6666666666666665,4.333333333333333,2.3333333333333335,5.0,4.0,4.666666666666667,4.666666666666667,4.666666666666667,2.0,4.666666666666667,romantic_partner,in_person

I'm going to work on finishing a mural.  I am also upgrading my desk.  So these are positive things for me.  Last weekend I taught a bunch of online classes.  I hope this weekend is the same, with lots of students.  Because I need to make some money to pay down my credit card and what not.  I recently had to buy new tires, too.  I'm also worried my city will go into complete lock down with the corona virus.   Yeehaw.  I guess I see my anxiety increasing throughout the week.","We managed to have a non-offensive conversation.  I don't think we laughed very much, and I felt uncomfortable sharing information about my personal life.  For example, I didn't tell my partner my name, even though the name I use is not my legal name.   But yeah, my partner has a cat and the cat was in the chat, too.  I have six cats and really like cats.  Her cat was black and gray and had smokey lines where the two colors meet.   Besides the cat, nothing bad, nor interesting, really happened.  ","I felt like my partner didn't really offer much in terms of ideas or energy.  I like a really snappy witty conversation with a lot of bullshit.  It felt like an awkward job interview rather than a chat with a friend.  Or maybe I was nervous.  I felt like I talked most of the time and maybe my partner didn't feel like I was giving her space to speak.  I don't know.  Maybe my partner was much younger than me and felt like I was kind of a crazy old man or something.  It wasn't a bad conversation, but we definitely did not vibe.",7.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,8.0,4.0,7.0,3.0,2.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,7.0,2.0,74.0,26.0,3.0,6.0,6.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,7.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,10.0,,,4.0,7.0,,,2.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,male,6.0,white,masters_degree,1.0,,7.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,36.0,8.0,,0.0,0.0,12.0,0.0,88.0,12.0,88.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,2.0,2.0,,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.5,4.333333333333333,2.3333333333333335,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,2.3333333333333335,4.666666666666667,5.0,2.0,3.0,3.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,other,video_chat
