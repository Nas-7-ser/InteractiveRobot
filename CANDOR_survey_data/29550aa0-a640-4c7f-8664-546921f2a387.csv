I've finally settled back into my routine after moving and I think I can make the progress I want to be making again. I've been struggling with getting into that after taking the last couple weeks off for packing and moving and those kinds of things.,"We had similar types of experiences and were able to communicate about various things pretty well. The conversation didn't really lag much once we got into it, though it did take a couple minutes to kind of settle into things. Overall the flow was pretty smooth and everything went fine.",We ended up getting somewhat locked into the same few topics and by the end I felt like I was kind of just repeating the same things because the conversation didn't really have much place else to go.
