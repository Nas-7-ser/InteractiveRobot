It's Mother's Day weekend so I am trying to plan out something with my mom (with whom I don't have a close relationship) but we are unsure of the plans. We might go to the beach since my state has reopened some things. I see my week going well, though, considering I do have something to look forward to for the first time in a couple of months.","We both seemed to be about the same age, and both have children in the house. We are in completely different parts of the country, though, so a lot of the conversation was comparing the differences in our lives based on our geographical location. She is in North Dakota and I live in Florida- we talked on things such as grocery stores, COVID-19 community response, and weather.","I think maybe the one thing that didn't work out was that I talked too much. I was worried about a lapse in the conversation and may have thrown out new topics too soon, or when she was about to give a response to the last topic we were talking about. I did try to keep the topics relevant to each other.

Next week at work will be a little stressful, but I'm hopeful that I'll get some important projects buttoned hope. The weather should be nice, so I'm looking forward to getting some hikes or jogs in after work. ","I think we are both friendly and kind people. We are both curious about the world and enjoy learning about new things, people, etc. We are around the same age range, have some similar experiences, and are both women and moms.We found topics to talk about that weren't small talk but weren't overly personal, either. ","I'm a bit introverted and self-conscious, so at times I stumbled over my words. I know that I talked over her at times, because I wanted to get a comment in, and then I felt bad. I also was wondering how she was perceiving me. Overall, it's always a little weird to try to have sustained conversation with a complete stranger, but she was so nice.
