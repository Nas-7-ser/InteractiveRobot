I think I'm getting some more work and I have some fun things to try. I want to practice braiding my hair and try some different styles. I'm getting food to go tomorrow and I'm excited about it.,I think we both tried to keep it going with different things. We both shared opinions and experiences. We also tried to keep things balanced between both of us freezing up on the video screen. We talked about some easy topics like our glasses and TV which made it easier to keep the conversation going.,I think I couldn't think of things to talk about so then my conversation partner had to mention more topics. I think it was hard to think of things we could have in common when we were meeting under these specific circumstances which didn't link anything in particular between us. ,4.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,8.0,7.0,45.0,55.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,8.0,8.0,6.0,2.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,4.0,25.0,,,5.0,,2.0,,2.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,female,6.0,hispanic_or_latino,bachelors_degree,1.0,,6.5,7.5,2.0,,False,,,26.0,13.0,,100.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,93.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0,,,,3.375,6.333333333333333,,1.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,4.333333333333333,3.3333333333333335,2.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,4.333333333333333,4.0,1.3333333333333333,3.3333333333333335,family,in_person

I usually spend a good amount of time on my computer and have been staying at home for most of the days. I will try to complete some chores throughout the days as well.",I really liked the person who I had a conversation with. She was friendly and seemed to have a similar personality to myself. We had some of the same interests and were able to elaborate on those similarities. We also had some differences and she was able to recommend me to new things I hadn't heard about. We each brought up topics to talk about and the conversation seemed to run smoothly. ,"Since we had no prior interaction with each other before the video conversation, I didn't know anything about the person I was having the conversation with. It's been awhile since I met someone new, so at times it was difficult for me to think of a new topic to talk about, but we still were able to keep the conversation flowing. Usually with people I know well, we can talk about one topic for a long time without having to change the topic and feel awkward about silences.
