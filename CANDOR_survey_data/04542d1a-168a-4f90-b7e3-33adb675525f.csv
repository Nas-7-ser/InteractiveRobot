We stay on the same subject.",7.0,7.0,8.0,"In the middle of the conversation, she was explaining her schedule and the frustrations that as a teacher in New York City, how to juggle all the things being thrown her way.  I was asking if a parent or PTAcould support teachers by maybe reviewing technology for her.   ",8.0,8.0,8.0,"Towards the end of the conversation we were still talking about education but now wondering if this group of people in the world, will it show up on jobs and life and abilities or will if not really matter that they aren't getting the ""education"" being in school.",8.0,8.0,9.0,8.0,9.0,7.0,6.0,9.0,87.0,3.0,85.0,0.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,1.0,9.0,6.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,8.0,6.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,6.0,9.0,8.0,9.0,9.0,7.0,8.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,6.0,7.0,The rest of the week I see myself completing at least 2 more house projects that I delved into when the pandemic started.  I also see me putting in orders for supplies thinking that numbers are going up and we want to make sure that we do not have to go out and pick up even essentials.  I also see myself doing more surveys.,"The fact that we were both teachers at some point in our lives, we had similar opinions about what is important in education.  I also could soooo relate to what she must be going through as a teacher during a pandemic so she was freely able to talk about her frustrations.  I hope I added and made her think about some of the things that might help her as she continues this year as a teacher.  I really liked talking to her. ",The only thing I can think of was that the reverb of me speaking from her computer was annoying.  Mine probably did the same thing since we did not have earbuds or microphones at our disposal.  I felt we interacted very smoothly and friendly because the topic was both something we had done in our lives.  I would have liked to find out about her travels but we never got to that.,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,3.0,40.0,60.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,9.0,9.0,2.0,2.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,,1.0,3.0,4.0,25.0,,,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,female,2.0,white,masters_degree,6.0,,6.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,54.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,30.0,13.0,10.0,2.0,2.0,31.0,2.6666666666666665,4.666666666666667,3.0,2.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,2.6666666666666665,5.0,4.666666666666667,2.0,4.666666666666667,,

I'm a teacher and she used to be a teacher, and is now very active in her son's education. We have a lot of the same opinions about the state of education right now and feel the same about how to manage the pandemic when it comes to learning.","I didn't really learn anything about her other than how she feels about education.
