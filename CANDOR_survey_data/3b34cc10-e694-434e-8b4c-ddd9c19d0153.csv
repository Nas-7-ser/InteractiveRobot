I thought this was very interesting.  We matched up pretty well, appeared to be of similar age. We also had teenage children so we had plenty we could chat about.","Nothing negative really happened. The only thing I would consider not working well, was just the beginning awkward factor.

Even though where I live we are in shelter at home mode I work outside of the home 6 days per week so my days are always very busy with work and trying to get the normal home life stuff completed. I imagine it will be its usual mundane schedule but I'm grateful for the ability to continue working.,My conversation partner was easy to talk with and the time went by quickly. I felt like there was an even amount of chat between us and flowed smoothly from one topic to another. It helped that we all have a common situation with the circumstances of the pandemic currently. It definitely gives you a point of reference to start a conversation with just about anyone.,If I had to pick something I would say that I felt like I perhaps dominated the conversation a bit much at times. Nothing unusual as I feel like that happens in other conversations when I meet people. I enjoy talking and meeting new people and I think my over enthusiasm for getting to know them is a little much sometimes. ,2.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,60.0,40.0,7.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,8.0,8.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,2.0,4.0,20.0,,,5.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,female,6.0,white,bachelors_degree,1.0,,6.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,53.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.5,6.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.6666666666666665,4.666666666666667,2.3333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,2.6666666666666665,4.0,3.3333333333333335,4.0,2.0,3.3333333333333335,,
