Work has been going well even during stressful situations, so I see no direct problems there. I'm attending a social gathering over the weekend so that will positively affect the rest of my week.","I think because we shared some common demographics, we were able to easily connect when discussing current issues and interests. My partner was very receptive and seemed to show a genuine interest in the topics we discussed. I know I personally tend to talk a lot, so I tried not to dominate the conversation. However, it was very easy to listen to her and there were very few points where I felt like the conversation lagged or got stuck.","Starting the conversation was a bit awkward but that was to be expected since we were total strangers. I reverted back to basic ice breakers, which aren't always the most interesting but they do work to get things going. We did spend a lot of time discussing how the pandemic has affected our daily lives, but that's really all people can talk about these days.",5.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,7.0,8.0,5.0,55.0,45.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,,1.0,2.0,5.0,,1.0,2.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,female,4.0,white,bachelors_degree,1.0,,10.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,24.0,7.0,,50.0,0.0,0.0,50.0,0.0,50.0,25.0,25.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,6.0,4.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,3.0,2.0,2.0,5.5,7.0,2.3333333333333335,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.666666666666667,4.333333333333333,4.666666666666667,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.666666666666667,5.0,2.6666666666666665,4.0,family,in_person

I get paid tomorrow, and I plan to have a small party with my boyfriend and some friends. I also think I might go out to dinner with my boyfriend somewhere nice. Today makes me a little anxious, as I have a class tonight with a big assignment due, but as long as I can get through it I will be okay.","She asked a lot of questions and shared information about herself. I think that the conversation flowed well, and we found a few things in common. Since the world has been experiencing a global pandemic, that helped us find common ground to build a long, full conversation and share our experiences more smoothly.","She asked far more questions than I did, which made me worry about her not feeling listened to. I also believe she may have been bored at some points in the conversation, as she glanced at the time a few times throughout the call.
