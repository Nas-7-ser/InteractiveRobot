Over all she asked me things I had good responses for and we were able to relate even though we aren't the same age, and we were able to have a good conversation. ","I think maybe I was too nervous and didn't really know a lot to talk about, so I didn't get too much out of my comfort zone, I also think I could've done a better job at talking more I feel like she held us together pretty good and I would like to do the same.",4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,9.0,9.0,7.0,50.0,50.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,6.0,9.0,9.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,,2.0,,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,female,3.0,hispanic_or_latino,some_college,2.0,,6.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,19.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7.0,7.0,,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,3.0,3.3333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,4.666666666666667,3.0,3.0,4.333333333333333,,

After thinking about it, I told her it went well, that I had spent time with my little brother, made brownies, and finished a book I'd been reading. I also mentioned playing with my kids. I asked the same. She said she enjoyed her day and had gone to the flea market with her mom and then to Ross to do some shopping. She asked about my kids - I told her that I have an almost 4 year old son and a 15 month old daughter and that they're great and funny. We talked briefly about previous conversations and she mentioned previously having sound issues that she thought were attributed to her boyfriend messing with their sound system. She said he messes with it all of the time when he's playing video games with his friends, even though she's told him to cut it out. After a segue, I told a story about something funny my son said recently. She said she could relate because she has a 7/8 year old little brother and a 5 year old little sister. She no longer lives with them, and lives about an hour away, but she still spends time with them every now and again. The last time she spent a day with her little sister her little sister told her she was going to steal her [Samantha's] boyfriend so they could spend more time together, which Samantha found both funny and surprising.",5.0,5.0,6.0,"She asked how I felt about being a mom and I said that I enjoy it and talked about the formation of my ""mom identity"" as of late, compared to how I viewed myself as a younger mom. I asked Samantha what it was like growing up with siblings substantially younger than her. She said it was hard because she was thrust into a maternal role at a young age and was often the only caretaker for her siblings because her parents had to work all the time. She told a story about needing to take care of her little brother during flu season when he was little and how she and her father had to trade responsibilities back and forth while they were both sick with the flu. She also mentioned that her little brother is autistic, and has related behavioral problems. She said her little sister used to be sweet but is now somewhat of a devil. I asked how being in her position has informed her decision to have children in the future. She said it's definitely made an impact on her trajectory and she knows how she might want to do it differently, if at all. I talked about my upbringing, as the younger sibling in that same type of arrangement, and growing up in what was effectively a single-parent household. I talked briefly about my older siblings and that my father was deported when I was a child. I explained how that had informed my desire to never be a single mom and to wait until I was older to have children. She said her parents were very young when they had her, 15 and 16, and that also impacted her decision. I mentioned that my mom was 17 when she had my sister. She said her little brother was a surprise pregnancy, even though her mother was on birth control and didn't realize she was pregnant until she was 7 months along. They realized her little brother was autistic when he was around 6 months old and didn't make eye contact. He then later had a speech delay. Her little sister was also a surprise pregnancy. I talked about how hard it must be to have a surprise pregnancy like that when you're actively preventing and then talked about having PCOS and the intention with which we conceived our son and then the mild surprise of our daughter.",9.0,7.0,6.0,"The end of our conversation was focused on our cats. Samantha has three cats who she considers her babies - Shadow, Precious, and Tigger. Tigger is her most recent acquisition. She strongly believes in rescuing cats and that you shouldn't shop for animals because there is always one who could use a home. She got Shadow from a household that wasn't really taking care of her and she nursed her back to health. Either Precious or Tigger came to her as a tiny kitten. Her so-called mother-in-law has a group of feral cats who have recently had kittens. She loves taking care of her cats and thinks she might end up with a fourth one, but doesn't think she can afford the vet bill. Plus she's afraid that her current cats would not accept a new one. I talked about my two cats and how I got them - first Ichabod, who was turned out of his litter and whom I've had for 6 years, and Ms. Kitty who is 18 years old. I talked about their dynamic living together and how Ichabod likes to pick on Ms. Kitty and how she picked on him as a kitten. She showed my two of her cats and talked about how they were playing with each other and how she's uncertain about how they're going to handle the transition of  moving into a bigger house, which will happen soon. We talked a lot about how cats love to hide and how they are lovable jerks who don't listen. After that we exchanged names, wished each other well, and signed off.",4.0,3.0,9.0,7.0,9.0,7.0,6.0,5.0,89.0,2.0,20.0,10.0,6.0,2.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,1.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,8.0,9.0,9.0,7.0,9.0,9.0,7.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,6.0,9.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,6.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,7.0,6.0,"The rest of this week is going to be very busy work-wise. I don't feel well right now and that is going to present a challenge to my schedule. I have to present to a decently large group of people, which will be difficult with a sore throat. At least it's not in person and I still have a couple of days to prepare.","Samantha was incredibly open and friendly, which made her easy to talk to. She was especially enthusiastic about her cats and our conversation exceeded past the required time because of our shared interest and willingness to talk about our pets. Her descriptions were very fun and she had a lot of stories to share. Once we got into the light-hearted territory of pets, the conversation felt mostly effortless.",There wasn't really much that didn't work well. I think if we had engaged on a more serious topic that might not have gone as well or effortlessly.
