I will also try to be productive and fix up some winter cat shelters.,We were both relaxed and went with the flow of conversation. We lived on the opposite end of the country so we asked each other how both coasts were handling COVID. It was easy to transition into talking about Mexico since he was close to the border. We aren't awkward people so that helped.  ,"I think we had a great and easy conversation. We could have talked for another few minutes, but I felt bad for keeping him since he was doing the chat from his girlfriend's parents house.
