I may check out some of the suggestions my partner had. Before that...

At first, it was only my partner talking. The topic she chose was, unfortunately, one that I don't know how to talk much about so I felt like I couldn't add much. Then I didn't know how to continue the conversation. Conversation petered out frequently - we just couldn't find much in common. And it felt like our exchanges were off.
Things only started going way mid-way in the conversation when I started to talk about my work with nonprofits, which I am passionate about.
