I need to find ways to share information and conference across different platforms. Such as video files, white papers and video conferencing. The organization is called the ""neurocollective"" and it is an autistic think tank.","I made an effort to not speak as much as i would naturally and pull back for the chat partner. Recognizing that this was supposed to be a conversation. My partner and I definitely were willing to have some depth to the conversation and provide motivations to our activities. I also made an effort to quell my tendency to speak at the same time as another person. This is a characteristic of my autistic configuration, to start talking when a thought emerges. This behavior is what is referred to as an ""Aspie mind dump.""","THe background images were a bit blurry, but I understand that the focal length of a web camera is much shorted and my video partner was very clear and detailed. I had to work at not spontaneous speaking and think I was partially successful.

He'd worked at Apple for about 20 years, which is cool because he was there through the advent of the iPhone.","My partner is autistic, which is perfectly fine, but he doesn't really pick up social queues. Consequently, he tended to talk a lot, not really leaving room for interjection or response.
