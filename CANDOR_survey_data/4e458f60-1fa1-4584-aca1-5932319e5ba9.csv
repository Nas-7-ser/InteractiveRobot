I also brought up the cost of renting an apartment in New Jersey. ,3.0,4.0,9.0,We were talking about a study that we had both participated in the past that involved real people and how we both had someone that screwed up one of the tasks and which required us to start all over in this specific study. ,3.0,4.0,9.0,We talked about doing tasks on usertesting and the fact that some of the tasks are really underpaid and can have question after question of required responses.

I also plan on doing some video calls with some friends of mines to keep in touch with them. ,What worked well was the fact that he stayed on the same topic for a very long period of time and was very slow in regards to discussing the topics that we did talk about. This allowed me to easily keep a conversation going with him even though the conversation was very boring. ,What didn't work well was the fact that he seemed distracted at the beginning and towards the end of the conversation. He seemed like he was more interested in just getting the conversation over with as soon as possible instead of actually talking about something interesting that we could both relate to. He seemed pretty impolite as well and started a usertesting task towards the end of our conversation. ,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,1.0,9.0,5.0,7.0,2.0,2.0,9.0,2.0,9.0,20.0,80.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,22.0,,,4.0,23.0,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,male,2.0,white,completed_high_school,1.0,,9.0,9.0,2.0,,False,,,32.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,2.0,,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,3.6666666666666665,1.3333333333333333,1.0,,

We spoke about a specific test on Prolific that we had both taken and both thoroughly enjoyed.  This mutual commonality was the most interesting part of the conversation for me.","Nothing in particular did not ""work out"" per se.
