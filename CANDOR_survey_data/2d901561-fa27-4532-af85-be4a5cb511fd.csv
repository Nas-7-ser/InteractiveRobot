Im not sure what im going to be doing yet but im sure i will find something fun to do. I will either go out with my friends or stay back at my place and play video games online with them. This is to off balance the fact that i have to pay bills soon and i dont like the process of having to pay them. ,What worked well is that we both had a lot of things in common. The guy liked video games. I liked video games. We both had a common like of pokemon so we mainly talked about pokemon for a solid  15 mins and then after that we started talking about the legend of zelda which we both liked and played a lot him moreso than me.,There wasnt anything that didnt work well in our conversation. We had something in common where we could both talk about for a while so we never got to that point where we had a dull moment or a moment of silence trying to figure out what to say next. ,9.0,9.0,9.0,1.0,9.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,9.0,2.0,70.0,30.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,9.0,9.0,2.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,2.0,,4.0,25.0,,,4.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,,male,4.0,hispanic_or_latino,bachelors_degree,1.0,,,,2.0,,False,,,28.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.625,6.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,4.333333333333333,4.0,1.0,5.0,2.3333333333333335,5.0,5.0,2.0,4.333333333333333,,

The rest of the week should be pretty normal but I like the way it supposed to be. Maybe have a nice dinner with my wife and watch some movies.,"I guess the pokemon drawing behind me really open up the conversation. He saw the painting that I drew and immediately change the topic to games, which we have a lot in common. I'm pretty surprise that his job is so fun and therapeutical and I would like to know more about him.","I guess the video and audio lagging was the biggest problem that we had. His video is always discconneted and I feel a little bit weird when talking to the black screen without seeing anyone's face.
