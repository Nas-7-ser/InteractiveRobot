I am thinking about thanksgiving coning up soon. It will be different this year than other years because of covid so i will be with my kids and grandkids for the day. I am going to start getting the preparations ready this week and make sure we have everything we need.,We had a great talk. I learned about covid from someone who had it first hand. Still same old question. Why do some people in the same house come down with it and others don't? We talked about holiday traditions that occur in our lives for thanksgiving and for Christmas and the way it will be different this year.,"Really everything worked fine, their was no moments that did not work. The conversation just kind of flowed out like we knew each other for our whole lives. We had the same beliefs and just understood each other.

I got a big new assignment at work that I feel pretty unprepared for. But my brother is coming in town on Thursday which I'm really excited for. I haven't seen my brother since before quarantine started. I'm really really looking forward to catching up with him,"We both were very amicable, and recognized that we had  shared faith early on. We both asked questions a good bit and listened well and were generally good natured and attentive. She was very sweet and reminds me of a lot of the folks I know at my church so it felt very natural to talk to her. ","I did feel, despite our connection through our faith, that she maybe had a different idea about me than who I really am. I'm a faithful person, and I think of myself as pretty mature and likable but I'm also 23 and like to goof off and I'm far from a perfect Christian and she seemed to sorta think of me as like a almost good-two-shoes but in a good way kindof person. I felt like I had to keep up that image for her.
