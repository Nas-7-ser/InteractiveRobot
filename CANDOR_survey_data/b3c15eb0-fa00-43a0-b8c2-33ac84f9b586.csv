We both live in Florida and were both transplants, we both had recently lost income, and we both were extremely concerned about COVID-19. We spoke about those topics and even shared tips, which kept our conversation flowing naturally. The time flew by.","I really can't say that anything didn't work well. We started off a bit slow because I think it's hard to meet someone new and just start talking without a clear subject, but once we broke the ice, within the first few minutes, we were good.
