I brought up school because it was something she knew/was involved in, so it seemed to open her up more, and help ease her into the conversation. I tend to talk a lot and about various things, so I kind of got a feel for her, so I knew what things would help her to engage with.","I think the fact that we didn't have much in common made it kind of hard, because there were a couple times where we were both silent, and trying to think of what to talk about. So surely our lack common ground made things difficult because once a particular conversation was over, it was hard thinking of where to go next.",5.0,5.0,3.0,6.0,4.0,2.0,7.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,8.0,7.0,3.0,60.0,40.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,4.0,7.0,8.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,2.0,4.0,20.0,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,7.0,6.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,male,3.0,white,completed_high_school,1.0,,9.0,6.0,2.0,,False,,,34.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.75,5.333333333333333,,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,3.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,4.0,4.333333333333333,1.6666666666666667,4.666666666666667,5.0,2.0,4.666666666666667,,

Overall, I think it could go okay or quite poorly depending on the decisions that I make over the course of the week.","The main reason why the conversation went as well as it did is because both of us were willing to fill in the gaps and ask questions of the other party when the current conversation topic petered out. I think that my conversation partner was especially good in this regard, as he was able to come up with new topics or leading questions relatively quickly. He was also able to contribute far  more than enough to the current conversation that I had enough time to prepare to respond or for a topic change.","I had difficulty talking about myself or offering meaningful insights during a couple points during the conversation. Instead, I only said a few sentences worth about myself and my opinions before letting my conversation partner carry the conversation further. Nearing the end of the interaction, I felt that my partner became a lot less engaged and was ready for the chat to be over.
