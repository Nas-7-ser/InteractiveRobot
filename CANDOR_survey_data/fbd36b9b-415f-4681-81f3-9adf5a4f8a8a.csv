I will be doing a lot of friends and family. I will also be doing just as much at work so I hope it will not be as stressful as it has been the last few weeks.,I like that the person was willing to talk and that they are doing some of the same things I am doing. I like that they had some of the same interest as I did and that we are dealing with many of the same things. I like that they are interested in surveys as well,I did not have any issues or feel that the  conversation when bad. We both gave our thoughts and both h]was kind and willing to listen to each other. I learned from them and I feel they learned from me as well.

I have a senior cat that is behaving strangely  and I worry for his health.  I hope for the best but dread my final days with him are near. I miss my fiancee. Wish she would come home to console me and our cats. ,He was kind and pleasant to speak with. No negative attitude and he was intelligent. Seemed understanding and not judgemental towards me. I tried to ask questions instead of just talking  about myself.  It was my first video interaction with a stranger and even though I was nervous I didn't feel judged,I think it went fairly well for my first video chat. We had things in common but I may have been too awkward. I was sweating with anxiety but I overcame it and I even thanked him for his kindness towards the end of the video.
