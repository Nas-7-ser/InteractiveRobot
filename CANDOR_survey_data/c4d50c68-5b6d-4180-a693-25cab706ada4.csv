My life is pretty hectic and chaotic right now and I expect that to continue. I do think I will probably be wondering if I hurt my conversation partner's feelings and if he is dwelling on my rejection of his offer to stay connected. ,I think we both gave each other opportunities to speak and tried not to interrupt. We seemed to flow from one topic to the next pretty well. Both of us were polite and kept the conversation going. We didn't really have trouble finding things to talk about. We easily reached our 25 minutes.,I felt like my conversation partner was a little pushy in trying to get my phone number and stay connected after this interaction. I came into this study guarded and with no intention of staying connected. It takes a lot for me to trust someone and his continuous compliments felt like inauthentic flattery that made me suspicious of his intentions and character.,2.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,9.0,9.0,5.0,55.0,45.0,6.0,7.0,3.0,7.0,4.0,9.0,9.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,20.0,,,5.0,,1.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,6.0,8.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,female,6.0,white,bachelors_degree,1.0,,8.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,32.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.125,4.666666666666667,1.6666666666666667,2.0,34.0,18.0,14.0,6.0,1.0,21.0,3.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,3.0,3.3333333333333335,4.333333333333333,4.666666666666667,4.0,3.0,1.0,3.6666666666666665,,
