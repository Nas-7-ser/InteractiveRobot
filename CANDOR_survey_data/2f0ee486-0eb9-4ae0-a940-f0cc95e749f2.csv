There was kind of a base level of interest that allowed us to feel comfortable sharing our lives and seemed to make the whole conversation just feel a lot more smooth.,"I think the fact that I had just woken up was perhaps not working in my favor as well. I was not completely attentive as I haven't had any coffee or breakfast yet. Other than that, I don't really think that there was much that was an issue.

I think there will be much work to be done and I am looking forward to Halloween coming soon and going trick or treating with my daughter. I think it will be a busy week and a productive week. Some new adjustments of my youngest daughter starting a new program on her remote days of school.,I think that speaking about certain topics that we both care about was positive. It helps to have similar interests. I think the age gap and where each of us is in our lives can be negative in being able to relate to mutual experiences. I feel that because I am an easy-going person that it is not difficult talking to me.,As I mentioned in the previous answer the fact we were at different stages in our lives can lead to not relating to one another and affecting the conversation.
