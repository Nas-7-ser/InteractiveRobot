I will clock out from work in about 45 minutes to start my weekend. I am looking forward to doing some heavy cooking this weekend and recipe planning for a contest. I also am looking forward to my bf being at work so I can have a little alone time for a couple of days. He was off the last 3 days, and because COVID has NC shut down, he is antsy and bored. Since I am working from home, I have habits and routines, and basically have gotten used to being stuck at home all of the time. ","Since we had things in common, we took off immediately. Both having bubbly talkative personalities leant well to conversing. We spoke about some general topics but ones that were interesting, not boring like the weather. We fed off of each other and laughed a lot. We were both entertaining I think","I am trying hard to come up with something. I know I was nervous so I had trouble searching for words, therefore starting looking away from the camera. I was totally into the conversation though. We are different ages, but still, feel it went extremely well without forcing conversation with one another.

",I think we both are naturally good at talking. We both had metally qued up topics to discuss next in the conversation. I can well we have naturally outgoing personalities. I also think we both listened to each other's interest and took note of what we liked to talk about. ,I don't think many things didn't work since the conversation was overall quite pleasant. Maybe if we had some questions to guide us it might have been easier but I think we were both good talkers.
