A friend of ours just had a baby so I will be putting together a meal to give them, and I also will be singing at our Church for this weekend's service so I am looking forward to that. My husband is also off the rest of the week so we will be getting ready for the holidays and decorating. It's going to be a really good week.","Everything. She was prepared and kind. She had some really interesting life experiences and stories to share. There were a lot of things that were interesting about her; she wrote a book, and had lived in Japan, it was nice to learn about someone you don't know and hear about their experiences in life. ","I can't recall anything that didn't work. The conversation was consistently moving I thought, we both listened well and spoke well. I don't have anything bad to say about my conversation partner or the conversation that we had just had.

I'm also celebrating my husband's birthday so there will some time spent preparing special food for him in celebration. I hope to also get some time in to pursue some relaxing and enjoyable tasks that I haven't had time to get to (crafts, writing, artwork).","I think that my conversation partner was buoyant and friendly. I think she may have been reserved on any topics of a social/political nature because of her husband's work in law enforcement and she may have found my comments off-putting, but chose not to react to them to keep things on a friendly basis. I think that sharing about our lives in general (hobbies, family, etc.) worked well, but ideologically, things fell a bit flat.","I think any mention of social/political issues didn't work. My guess is that we weren't in alignment on this particular point, but she was tactful and didn't react to whatever I may have said which she didn't agree with. In retrospect, I wished that I hadn't brought these things up because they may have made her feel uncomfortable and that was not what I wanted.
