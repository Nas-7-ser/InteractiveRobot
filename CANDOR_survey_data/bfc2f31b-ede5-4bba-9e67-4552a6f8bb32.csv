Both me and my wife have off tomorrow and this weekend so we will enjoy that time together. I plan on exercising tomorrow and Saturday. My wife and I will probably go out to eat dinner tomorrow and Saturday as well.,I think the fact that we had a lot in common made the conversation pleasant. We were able to hold a long conversation over just a couple of topics since we both had similar experiences. We are also both from the same state so I think that gave us another thing that we could relate to.,I think for the most part everything worked well. The only thing that I can think of that didn't work well is the fact that my conversation partner brought up religion in our conversation. I am not a religious person and it makes me a little uncomfortable when people bring up religion in a conversation with a stranger.,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,8.0,6.0,8.0,7.0,40.0,60.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,7.0,8.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,,1.0,2.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,8.0,8.0,7.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,male,4.0,white,bachelors_degree,1.0,,8.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,29.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,5.125,6.333333333333333,2.0,1.6666666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.6666666666666665,5.0,2.6666666666666665,1.6666666666666667,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.333333333333333,2.0,4.0,,

I will study for Bible study. I will exercise daily. I will grocery shop and cook meals. I will tend to my bees and my garden. I will meet friends over the weekend at a brewery and take in a concert. ,The fact that we were respectful of one another and asked good questions. We have a common background in education so that gave us a good bit to discuss. I was particularly curious about the online learning situation and his take on it as a teacher. It is nice to discover that you have a common background.,"There were times the video or sound lagged, but all in all I think the conversation was amicable. There was good eye contact. We had a decent amount of similarities and probably things we would not see eye to eye, but that's to be expected.
