Still spending time with family while I'm stuck here staying with them. ,"We were able to quickly find something we have in common, which was our mutual love of cats. I think even without that, the current situation provided some common ground to start from and we did start there, but the conversation really felt like it clicked once we got to something else we both liked and could talk about outside of that. ","We both had moments of struggling to continue finding topics, though that didn't tend to drag on for long. Trying to talk continuously for a set amount of time provides a challenge and I feel like neither of us were really used to having extended conversations with a stranger.
