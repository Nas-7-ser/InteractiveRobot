Great times!","I think that the best thing about the conversation was that although it started slowly, we both developed a concern for each other and were able to communicate effectively.  I think we developed a rapport, and a genuine interest in each other.

","My conversation partner knew how to keep a conversation flowing, something which historically I have had a bit of trouble with.

I do feel like I wasn't quite as back and forth as I could have been though. Since this was a first conversation, it's largely introduction and ""getting to know"" the other person.
