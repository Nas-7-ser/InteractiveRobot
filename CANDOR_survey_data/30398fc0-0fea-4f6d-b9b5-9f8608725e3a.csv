Actually, I have one exception - tonight a writing contest I entered begins so I will have that to work on. I have been doing research that I hope to continue. I also get to play games with my kids and spend time with my husband - I count myself lucky. ","I think the conversation was easy because the girl was between my son and daughter's age so I knew just what to ask to keep the conversation going. I know how to relate to her, from a parent's perspective and how to make her feel comfortable and ask open ended questions. I realized we never introduced ourselves which was odd. ","The only thing weird was that we forgot to introduce ourselves. Honestly though she was great to chat with. I could tell that she was nervous at first, but I think I knew how to put her at ease. There was a disparity in our ages, but she had experiences that i have never had so it was fun to learn from her.

I plan on having a movie night with friends tonight but the only issue is we have not figured out what movie to watch yet. I hope we pick a good movie to watch so we have a great time. Then, tomorrow I plan on going for a walk and baking some cakes for my picnic with friends on Sunday. On Sunday, I will be grocery shopping for snacks and some snacks for the picnic as well. At the picnic, it will be gathering with friends and possibly kayaking or hiking which is nice.","I think it worked well when we realized we were from a similar region in the United States as we could bond over something. She realized I was the same age as her daughter which helped because we talked about school and other things. Also, we talked about COVID and how that's affected us and limited our social interactions. ","I think it was the areas with sharing too much personal information about ourselves. Also, it is harder to bond someone from a different generation as our ages are wide apart. Also, there were parts where the video lagged so the video stopped and the sound dimmed but I was able to repeat what I was saying and she was able to repeat what she was saying.",6.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,7.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,6.0,45.0,55.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,8.0,8.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,25.0,,,4.0,25.0,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,female,4.0,asian,some_college,7.0,Part time and student,7.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,24.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.875,6.0,,1.6666666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.3333333333333335,4.0,4.0,2.3333333333333335,4.0,3.6666666666666665,4.0,4.0,2.3333333333333335,4.0,,
