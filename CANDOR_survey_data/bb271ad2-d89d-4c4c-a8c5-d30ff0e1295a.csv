I would say something and he would miss it because he was distracted by something else. I had to keep the conversation going by asking questions. We didn't have much in common. He doesn't seem to believe in education and I have a masters. ,I just answered this question in the last question. He was distracted by another screen that he kept looking at. He didn't have much to say so I had to ask more questions than he did. He didn't seem that interested in what I had to say.
