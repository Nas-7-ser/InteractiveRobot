I will have more time to do my homework and online course work, but I feel like I am wasting time because they will not be used wisely.

We are both going through staying at home order even though I am still going outside mainly for essentials, we know of the experience of how hard to get a job, and we have gone to school where not all classes that were taken were part of a goal for the future.","I think I talked more than my partner did. I believe that more information were being said by me and that there was not enough times for him to step in and put his own thought in to it. That does not mean that I never let him speak, just that when I think back, I might have talked more even though he had no issues talking himself. We never went into a topic that neither of us could not speak of, we had plenty of things to say about it, I think I just spoke more than needed.",6.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,9.0,3.0,7.0,5.0,7.0,4.0,4.0,8.0,3.0,60.0,40.0,6.0,1.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,9.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,,2.0,,2.0,6.0,5.0,7.0,5.0,1.0,7.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,male,4.0,black_or_african_american,bachelors_degree,1.0,,6.0,6.0,2.0,,False,,,32.0,3.0,,100.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,75.0,0.0,25.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,7.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,,4.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,4.75,5.333333333333333,2.3333333333333335,1.6666666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.3333333333333333,4.666666666666667,2.0,5.0,1.6666666666666667,3.3333333333333335,4.666666666666667,5.0,1.0,3.3333333333333335,family,in_person
