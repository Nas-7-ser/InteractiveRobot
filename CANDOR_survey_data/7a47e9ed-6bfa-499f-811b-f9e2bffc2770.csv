","I think we had some things in common, the anonymity made me comfortable to be myself (generally I don't feel comfortable talking about video games with other people) but I really enjoyed it and there were some good talking points and interesting points of views. Overall I think that most of it went well. ","I did not think there was all that much that went wrong, I am not a great conversationalist, so I find it hard for me to be comfortable and strike conversations.
