We seemed to to agree on important topics like  politics science and religion. When 2 people having a conversation have a common bond it makes the conversation go smoother. It Jake topics come up more naturally as if you were friends,Well most things worked with my conversation partner from today's experiment. The hardest part for me that I really had to work hard at were getting over my shyness and my bad nerves. It is award having a conversation with a stranger. If I had a drink first I would be more relaxed. ,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,8.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,8.0,5.0,40.0,60.0,6.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,8.0,8.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,8.0,,,4.0,20.0,,,7.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,other_or_prefer_not_to_answer,6.0,white,some_college,2.0,,6.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,60.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,6.375,6.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,4.666666666666667,2.0,3.3333333333333335,5.0,3.3333333333333335,4.0,3.0,2.6666666666666665,5.0,,

I have some work to do, but most of it is work that I like doing. And I have some other very nice activities coming up as well. And we have for a very long time due to COVID, having friends over for dinner. So I look forward to the rest of the week. ","We shared similar views on politics and religion, so those topics went well. And we also seemed to agree on how communicating with not so like-minded people can sometimes be very challenging. We sort of had similar experiences with that, so that made the conversation go fairly easy. I also think my conversation partner was nervous in the beginning but that passed very quickly, so that was positive.","Well, my conversation partner was calling from her cell phone, which made for a very wobbly image and a bad connection at times. She seemed also a bit nervous in the beginning of the conversation. I am afraid to admit that it became hard to find common topics to discuss later un the conversation.",1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,7.0,3.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,40.0,60.0,3.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,2.0,8.0,8.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,9.0,,,4.0,11.0,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,male,4.0,white,masters_degree,1.0,,7.0,6.0,2.0,,False,,,49.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.25,5.333333333333333,,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,2.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,4.666666666666667,3.0,4.0,3.6666666666666665,3.0,2.6666666666666665,,
