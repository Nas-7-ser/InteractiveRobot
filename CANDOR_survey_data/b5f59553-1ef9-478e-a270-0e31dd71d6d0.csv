I mentioned I had a long day while she mentioned that she had a fairly easy going day. Then briefly talked about what I did and then what our major's were in college.,7.0,5.0,7.0,"We started talking about what her major was in college and what she wanted to do with her degree, which was pre-med going into dermatology. I also talked about what I planned on doing with my degree, but was unsure of the specifics other then genetic counseling. At one moment we also briefly talked about our pets. ",7.0,6.0,5.0,"We finished by talking about the difference between the experiences we had in high school, varied on size. Starting with me mentioning computer programming, I mentioned how little my school was equipped to teach the subject compared to hers and that it really wouldn't be too important for her to learn for what she wanted to do as a career. Which I ended up personally feeling bad about not having asking her name at the beginning of the conversation.

Although after talking to my advisor today, I am a little sad I won't be able to sign up to Organic Chemistry 2 if I want to get what's required for my general done.","I think what worked the absolute best was that we were both interested in the biological sciences. As soon as my partner mentioned that, I really felt more comfortable than I may have normally been in my previous conversations. I feel bad for actually mentioning that we were at time and that I didn't mention my name previously, because I really felt like we could have kept going longer.","Thinking about it now, I think I may have talked too much during the conversation. Conversations in general require that both people contribute to the subject or personal experiences, I feel I expressed too much of mine while not asking about hers. If i had to give a reason, I'd say I felt TOO comfortable in sharing our science majors that I took most of the focus of the conversation.

I will go to class, do homework, and watch TV for most of the day. I might stay up late playing Among Us or Uno with some of my friends. I may FaceTime some of my friends, which will be fun.","I think Matthew, my conversation partner, was very agreeable and friendly. When there was a lull in the conversation, he would ask a question, which made it so that the conversation flowed and was never awkward. Matthew also had much different experiences (hometown, college size) than I did, so it was really interesting to hear a different viewpoint. He also had some very similar experiences (major, life career) so it was good to discuss those as well.","Not much didn't work well. He described himself as an introvert and I am an extrovert, so I was a little worried that I came off as too much, so I was actively toning myself down. Also being a bit of an extrovert, I felt that I was interrupting him, so I felt a little bad about it.
