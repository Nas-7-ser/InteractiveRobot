I think she is a bit younger than I am, but we were able to find common ground. And she asked me a question about my livestock, specifically goats, which got the ball rolling. It was an easy transition to talk about turkeys and snakes and the book I am writing.","From my end, everything worked well. I learned she has children, does home schooling, lives in texas, is married, hates snakes, and is creeped out by holes.
