My wife and I have dinner plans with some friends tonight and I hope to get some work done on some shop projects and hopefully some reading.

We had connections and talked about our lives and families in a pleasant manner. I think people in the US have more in common and can connect well if we just listen and give each other a chance. My conversation partner was kind and we connected over several things.,"Nothing that I can think of. I felt awkward at times if I wasn't asking a question of her, or if I paused too long, but I do have general anxiety disorder and social anxiety, so I usually overthink conversations and social interactions.

It will be the weekend, so catching up on sleep and some downtime.  Lots of time spent with my son and his friend, so plenty of games and nerf gun wars.  With the nice weather plenty of time outside, including a hike and kayaking.  Overall, a destressing weekend to recover from the long week.","What worked well was that I started by commenting on his dog.  That immediately put him at ease and had something to build from.  Additionally, I could see music equipment in the background, so was able to build on that topic, as my brother-in-lasw is in the music business. Then, we had some schooling in common, and it turned out both of our grandmothers lived in Ann Arbor, Michigan for some time.  From there, we were able to converse about work and then COVID-19 issues.  ","Toward the end, when talking about work and COVID-19 issues, the conversation stalled a bit.  I could tell that he was frustrated with how his company was handling the situation.  Unfortunately, my experience has been very different, so our conversation stalled a bit there.  Also, we are in very different places in life, so points of view and experience could have led to some disconnect.",1.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,3.0,60.0,40.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,8.0,8.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,,2.0,,4.0,20.0,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,female,4.0,white,masters_degree,1.0,,5.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,47.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.375,5.333333333333333,,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.333333333333333,3.6666666666666665,2.0,4.333333333333333,4.0,4.0,4.0,,
