Also the general topics of coronavirus and prolific were good to fall back on because we both obviously have experience with both those things.","Since he wasn't in school and wasn't a student I wasn't really sure what to ask him about his life. He seemed pretty happy with ""doing nothing"" but that doesn't lead to a lot of conversational options.

Then after that I am going to find a nice dark place to curl up and not engage socially with people for the next week. I am peopled out, the rest of my week is going to be a very nice week of not having to talk to, think about, or otherwise deal with other people.","The thing that worked the best was the fact that there is a single topic that all people can share with each other no matter what; the current world order. Past that there was also the fact that my conversation partner was somewhat critically thinking and intelligible, and at times would bring up topics or ideas that could be very interesting to engage in and discuss. ","The biggest let down, and the main reason why this conversation was somewhat disappointing was the fact that at multiple points my conversation partner would begin to talk about a concept, idea or thought which could actually hold weight and be an interesting conversation to pursue to only then return to talking about the current world situation, quickly jumping past the points I was interested in, back to idle chatter.",3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,7.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,3.0,57.0,43.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,14.0,,,5.0,,2.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,6.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,male,3.0,white,completed_high_school,7.0,Unemployed and not looking for work,14.0,14.0,2.0,,False,,,21.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.125,3.6666666666666665,,1.6666666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,3.0,1.3333333333333333,1.0,4.666666666666667,2.0,2.3333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,2.3333333333333335,,
