We discussed some shortcomings that we felt our school response had, and he talked about his work from home and his greenscreen. ",7.0,4.0,7.0,"The middle of the conversation was interesting, as we deviated somewhat and began talking about how we found these research studies on Prolific. We talked about the software prolific used and how he understood some of it because of his background in computer science, along with wondering about the Prolific user demographic. ",7.0,5.0,6.0,"Towards the end of the conversation, we talked a bit about the current administration's coronavirus response and the possibility of a virus, and my conversation partner talked about how with his wife's experience, he likely would not expect a vaccine.

I expect to follow the same routine I have been following in college of staying indoors for the most part, save for walking to the grocery store once a week and going on a walk daily when the weather is nice. ","During the conversation, we shared values and talked a lot about the college experience. I feel like the fact that I was in college and he had just gotten out of it led to a good dynamic as he would remember what he used to do in college. I also liked how he talked about his wife's relevant experience in medicine while I was talking about my areas of study, as I found him to be very knowledgeable. ","During the conversation, getting momentum to get started was rough. Especially at the beginning, I did not know what sort of topics we should start with, aside from the main issue with the pandemic. I feel that during this time, we all have this one issue to talk about so it becomes the dominating factor in many conversations even if that doesn't have to be the case. After talking about the pandemic, we had an awkward pause because aside from expressing the usual COVID complaints, we did not know what else to talk about for a moment.

We didn't have to share personal details (even names) but were able to get a sense of the other person's situation and make small talk in an open and honest way. We were also comfortable recognizing lulls in the conversation and moving past them without needing to draw attention to them or be overly awkward about it.,"It is just a little awkward having a conversation face to face with a total stranger via the internet, so there were the expected ""So...uhm...what about [thing]?"" moments where we had to reach for something to keep the chatter going.
