We were around her so we need to be cautious as well.  If the test is negative, we will go about our daily life as usual.  Hopefully get outside when the weather warms up next week.","Rebecca was fairly open with me about where she lives and her job.  She was open to all my questions and conversation flowed a little bit slow, but not uncomfortable.  She did ask questions of me such as if I work or not.  Offered information about her travel to Destin, FL where we will spend 2 months next year.",I felt I had to carry the conversation and ask leading questions.  Rebecca seemed a little reserved and quiet but very approachable and open to our conversations and questions I asked.  I could have talked longer with her but I felt I needed to come up with the topics.

She gave me hope about the future without even realizing it. I hope to be able to do as many great things as she does when I finally get to retire. ,I did not know what to say. I felt so young and inexeperienced compared to her. I was worried about making myself look dumb. The age gap also made it hard to find a lot in common.
