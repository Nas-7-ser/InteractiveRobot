We also discussed sports. ,5.0,5.0,4.0,We primarily talked about the state of the restaurant business and how bad it was doing. I talked about things that I knew about how large chains were expanding and were going to move into areas where small independent restaurants were previously. ,5.0,5.0,6.0,My partner mentioned her age and we talked a little bit about my small town and how some people didn't want to be helped. We discussed the perspective of being working class and I mentioned how money has changed me. ,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,50.0,5.0,32.0,36.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,6.0,8.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,I think the rest of the week is going to be ok. I am hoping it does not rain all week. I am hoping to find time to run outside as I need to get back into a regular rhythm of doing so. I am hoping I am able to execute my tasks at work without too much issue. ,I think we related decently in some regards mainly in terms of perspective. I think it helped that neither of us were not too judgmental and kept an open mind. We did not have many awkward silences because I liked to keep the conversation going due to my discomfort with awkward pauses. ,"I think I probably talked too much. But I am not great at steering a conversation in a way that lets others get deep into what they might be interested in talking about. I sometimes hope that there was somebody that was more interested in talking so that I could listen and learn, but I do not get that often from people.

It will be a great week.,The person I talked to was very easy to talk to.  He had a lot to talk about so I let him tell me about those things for as long as he wanted to.  I would say things at times and he was always welcome to hear my side as well.,I don't think there was anything that didn't work very well.
