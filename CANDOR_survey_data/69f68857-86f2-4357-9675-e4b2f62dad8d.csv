I asked him a bunch of questions and he always answered them in detail, rather than just giving one word answers.  He was friendly and open to talking about his city.",He didn't ask me any questions about myself so I didn't know how to segue into sharing about myself without sounding like I was about to steal the conversation.  I think I mentioned 3-4 things about myself but he never asked any follow up questions about them or addressed them/ acknowledged those facts.,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,8.0,4.0,6.0,2.0,6.0,9.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,95.0,4.0,6.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,8.0,6.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,15.0,,,4.0,2.0,,,4.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,female,2.0,asian,bachelors_degree,6.0,,9.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,44.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.125,3.0,,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,4.666666666666667,2.3333333333333335,4.0,2.0,3.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,2.6666666666666665,4.0,,

We had a nice dynamic going where she would ask questions and I would answer them in detail, so the whole conversation went as such. She asked questions and I answered, while I did not ask questions.","I was somewhat apprehensive to starting conversation since I did not know what her and I would have in common, since she lived in another part of the country and was very much older than I.
