The first questions directed to/about him didn't really resonate but once I asked him what he had been doing for fun during Covid, he lit up. That's when he started talking about the things that interested him and they were quite interesting.","You can tell that he's a nice guy but not a warm-fuzzy sort and I suspect a bit of an introvert.
