My conversation partner and I seemed within 5-7 years of age to each other, which made me feel comfortable when speaking to them. We have both worked in retail and likely have similar political opinions which helped the conversation.","something that did not work as well in the conversation I just had was the difference between where we each are within our lives. my conversation partner had recently gotten married and is working full time living with their spouse. on the other hand, I am still in college as a full-time student and I live with roommates. the difference between where we're each at in our lives was interesting",3.0,5.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,6.0,9.0,9.0,5.0,60.0,40.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,6.0,5.0,9.0,9.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,,1.0,1.0,4.0,25.0,,,5.0,3.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,4.0,6.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,female,6.0,white,bachelors_degree,7.0,full time student,8.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,22.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,2.0,3.0,5.5,6.333333333333333,2.0,1.0,25.0,14.0,13.0,3.0,5.0,55.0,3.0,4.666666666666667,2.3333333333333335,3.0,3.6666666666666665,2.3333333333333335,4.666666666666667,4.666666666666667,1.6666666666666667,4.333333333333333,,
