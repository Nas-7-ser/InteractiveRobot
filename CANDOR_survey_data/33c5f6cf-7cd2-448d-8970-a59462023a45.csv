We were able to find mutual interests to talk about.  For christs sake she knows someone who worked with Carol Baskin!!! And says that she didnt kill her husband.  We discussed regional differences, and overall she was a really nice woman.","The conversation was great,  there were very few moments that lapsed.

I wont be stressed out over bills because they are already paid. I will feel more inclined to reach out to others with mothers day coming up. Over all I think the rest of the week will be nice once done with work. ,The other person was really nice and could find things to talk about. They were able to take lead of the conversation easily and had a lot of life experience so it was cool to hear all the adventures they had been on. They never let a dull moment go by with awkward silence. ,They were much more of a talker than I am. If around them too much I feel like I wouldn't be able to get too much talking done but for this it worked well.
