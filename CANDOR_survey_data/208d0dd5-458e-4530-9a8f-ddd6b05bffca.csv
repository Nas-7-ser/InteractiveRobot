We then started talking about her kids and what grades they were in and what their current school setup was.",8.0,8.0,7.0,"We both talked about our approaches to dealing with kids during the pandemic and strategies for getting together with other kids, visiting friends and family, and how comfortable we were with different activities in public.",8.0,8.0,8.0,We talked about one of the challenges of schooling in person - with my recent experience of my kids getting a cold and how that resulted in needing COVID testing.,5.0,6.0,8.0,8.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,7.0,61.0,3.0,30.0,30.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,1.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,5.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,7.0,8.0,7.0,8.0,7.0,8.0,6.0,"I have a busy next couple of days, with some doctor appointments and a lot of work to squeeze in, often with kids around.

We both have kids in similar age groups and going through altered school schedules (her kids remote and mine in a hybrid schedule). We could swap a lot of stories about our recent experiences that the other person could totally relate to, as well as offer each other advice and encouragement during this interesting time.","At first, I thought that my partner seemed a little bit negative or pessimistic, so I remember thinking that this might be a challenging or less than enjoyable conversation.

I didn't even tell her some of the things I noticed we have in common, but the conversation was nice because we got along well. It helped that we seemed to have a similar philosophy on current issues. She was friendly and casual and made the chat easy.","I think any interaction when you've never met each other and don't know anything about the other can feel awkward and a little forced. I think it could have been a poor experience had we not had enough in common.
