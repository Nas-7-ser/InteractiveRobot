Sunday I will get together with coworkers (we already see each other everyday so no harm, really).","Pam was probably around my mother's age or a little older, but she was very sweet, lively, and easy to talk to. We both enjoy hiking, dogs, and going to restaurants (and margaritas). We both also live in the South, and I learned she lives in the county next to my cousins. We are both polite and friendly so I think most of all, that is why our conversation went so well and flowed so easily. It didn't even feel like 25 minutes, it was so easy.","No problems happened with the video or sound quality. Sometimes Pam would position the camera a little too high and it would cut off the bottom of her face, but that is hardly worth complaining about at all.

I have a number of important meetings set up which I expect to be fruitful. I am adjusting to being sequestered so I am finding that I am more productive than I was at an earlier time in the pandemic. I was pleasantly surprised by how fun this chat was and I take energy from outside so it was energizing to me to have something new and fun which included conversation with a new person.,She was immediately friendly and always had a smile. Her work is interesting and she shared it easily. At the same time she was also interested in asking me about my work. She seems like a happy person who enjoys where she lives and where she is in life while at the same time is open to where things may take her. I love talking with people like that.,I was a little distracted up front because I hated how old I looked in the video- and then a very young person came on to talk! I found that I was a little self-conscious throughout the call because of that!
