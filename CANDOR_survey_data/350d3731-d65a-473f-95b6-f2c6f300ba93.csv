I plan on getting more cleaning and organizing done as well as some craft projects. I am getting my car worked on so I will be stuck at home so I intend to make the best of it and be as productive as possible. ,"We had a lot in common, and agreed on every topic we discussed. We talked about lots on interesting things going on in our states, lives, and society as a whole. We both feel that many people are refusing to wear masks for Covid-19 because they want to start trouble. We think that kids today are not aware of just how hand sanitizer works, and we believe that there are too many things now that will make kids sick. We laughed at each other's comments, our beliefs about others, and our agreement that Florida has lots of problems going on.","We had a nice smooth conversation with no lags, or interruptions. We flowed easily from one topic to the next in total agreement about each other's ideas. We got along very, very well with no instances of disconnect, judgements, dismay, anger, or disbelief.

She asked questions, but also left things open at the end to prompt new questions. We smiled and joked. She even said that she was enjoying the conversation that she lost track of time - which is positive feedback to me, thus I continued talking for a bit longer.","We had to fish around to find conversation topics that we can both contribute to. This was to avoid a single sided talker. We did the news, current events, even cleaning the house topics.
