I anticipate that with proper planning it shall be a good week. My son is on summer vacation and we will enjoy some time outdoors, taking photos and geocaching.","Unlike the last conversation I had through this portal, this conversation was constantly moving and full of energy. I did not struggle to find conversation topics. We are both in states that are on similar paths with COVID-19 so found it easy to break the ice and as time went on we found other similarities to chat about.","I really don't have anything to report here, the conversation went much better than anticipated. Time went by very fast and I would have been happy to talk to him longer.

Will probably be very structured with about 8 hours of studying a day but also interspersed with some break times and relaxation so I don't crack under pressure. Maybe play a bit of tennis a few days a week or exercise in the mornings. ,I thought we were both very extroverted people who had an easy time conversing. She was from Florida which I love so we started the conversation off of that and it was nice to find some common ground right off the bat. We had similar viewpoints about the current scenario.,Honestly I thought the conversation went super well and didn't really have any bad factors( she even remarked that we didn't have a single pause in talk which was actually really nice!). I guess I might have said some stuff that may have been exaggerated that I heard on the news and she was kind enough to correct me. ,7.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,8.0,6.0,45.0,55.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,6.0,7.0,8.0,9.0,7.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,2.0,4.0,23.0,,,3.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,8.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,male,2.0,asian,some_college,7.0,student,7.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,21.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.0,6.0,,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,4.666666666666667,2.3333333333333335,2.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,3.0,4.666666666666667,4.333333333333333,1.3333333333333333,3.6666666666666665,,
