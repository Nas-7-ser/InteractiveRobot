My birthday is coming up, so I'm very excited about that. I'm currently visiting with some family, and it has been uplifting so far. I'm looking forward to tackling some interesting work projects this week, and I'm looking forward to reconnecting with friends later this week at least virtually. I'm very optimistic. ","With the conversation I just had, we were both open to each other and interested in hearing what the other person said. She was very kind, and we did not talk over each other. We seemed to have similar values or we cared about similar things. We are very different though - different lifestyles and different professions such that we could keep asking each other questions. ","I don't think there was anything that didn't work well. Towards the end of the conversation, we started talking about the foster care systems, and I think we had differing perspectives. However, we were both very respectful and still interested in hearing what the other person say. There was no negativity in our interaction at all.

The weather is forecasted to be nice so I know my husband and I will get to take advantage of that by going to a local park nearby.,"The reason that my conversation partner and I were able to have an easy flowing discussion is that we both had easy points to draw from. We also had a lot in common such as studying humanities, being raised by an immigrant family, and not growing up eating a lot of the typical American foods.  ","Mostly the conversation flowed very easily but there were a few technical issues. For some reason, my webcam was aimed too high and so I ended up sitting on a pillow to be higher up. Once in awhile my conversational partner's webcam's her video lagged but I was still able to hear her.
