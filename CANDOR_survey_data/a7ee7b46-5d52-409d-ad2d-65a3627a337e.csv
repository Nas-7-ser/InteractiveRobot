We stuttered a bit starting out, but once we introduced ourselves by first name, we relaxed into the conversation. She is very young, so talking about her schooling and my youngest son seemed to do the trick. Education is expensive.","Like I said already, she is very young. I felt the conversation was artificial. If we met in line at a coffee place or whatever, we probably would not have spoken. I believe we were both in it for the money. We didn't cover a wide range of topics, it was difficult to change topics or start new ones.

She was also very respectful and we each had equal time to talk.","There was a significant age difference, but that didn't really impact me as much as it did her.
