I have a lot of work to do, but got a lot done yesterday. I am disabled, so I have good days and bad days. I'm just so proud of myself for doing this study. I've been doing surveys for one year now and have been too reluctant/shy to do focus groups on web cam and recorder. It was so easy and had a good time. The funny thing is when I was younger I was incredibly shy (almost a handicap), and I came out of my shell after highschool. The older I get the less shy I've become. Once I start talking to someone, it gets easier and easier. I'm so glad to be out of that prison. I'm still a little bit shy, but better than coming on too strong, in my opionion. I forgot how many words I was supposed to use. :(  I think as people get older they don't sweat the small stuff anymore. Life is too short. He was a very nice guy and I enjoyed talking with him. He was very pixely (is that a word?) and I lost him several times during our chat, but could still hear him. He said I was crystal clear. Other than that, everything worked out well. We talked about sports, a little about Covid-19, we're both married with kids--talked about our kids. It was a nice conversation. The only thing is it cut out at the end, so I don't know if our conversation was over or something happened. Wish we could have said goodbye. I didn't see a timer at the bottom of my screen, but looked at my watch and seems like we talked about 25 min. Thank you.","Our conversation from the start worked well. He said he had never done one of these types of surveys before, and I said the same thing. So that broke the ice immediately. We both like sports, are married with children (older adult males for me). He seemed to perhaps live in more of a rural area, whereas, I live in a suburban area. He mentioned that they don't even have a hockey team and lives near a pork plant, which led us to talk about the Covid and people not wearing masks,etc. We both kept talking over each other. I'm not sure if it was a delay, but we were both eager to speak to each other. There was never a lull in the conversation. My dad always said, ""You're a great conversationalist, Lynn."" I said, ""Oh, in other words, I talk to much huh?"" :)  I spoke about how I haven't been able to work in almost three years. Worked in management in food service for 2 out of 8 years, and he said how stressful of a job that is. He didn't mention what he did. I told him my first name and what city and state I live in. He said he lives right outside of Kansas City. I feel like from the short conversation we got to know each other fairly well. I'm not one of those super private people, but I know what not to give out on the internet for my protection. One of the first things he said was that his wife was nearby. That was okay, but I could see he was making it clear he was married. I mentioned my husband to make it clear to his wife I wasn't interested and I'm not on Tinder. :)  I think our common interests made the conversation easier, but I usually get along with everyone. If the guy was a business man and highly intelligent, I would still enjoy asking questions and don't let that stuff intimidate me. I guess working in customer service for 26 years has helped me converse a lot better.","Oops, I think I may have already said this. Right from the get-go he mentioned his wife was nearby, so that made me feel a little uneasy/awkward. I said hello to her but she didn't reply. Maybe she's very jealous. My husband is, and I know he would not like me talking to this guy, even though I have no intentions of seeking out other men. I'm not on Tinder. Also, we kept talking over each other. I think there was a lag, because there were other technical issues on his end (I think). There really wasn't anything that didn't work well in the conversation. Time flew and there were no lulls whatsoever. We probably could have talked a lot longer but the time was up or something happened. I waited 5 min. to see if he'd reconnect, but he didn't. He was very polite and there was no negativity. I was so afraid I'd get stuck with someone who didn't have much to say. Not the case at all.

We had a bit of bad news with a vehicle.  I am hoping we can figure out some good news with the vehicle and get it properly licensed and on the road.  I am hoping this dark cloud I have had over me for a few days will lift and I am able to see things in a more positive note.  I need to turn that frown upside down if you will.  I am going to do it now and say by the end of the week all our questions will be answered and with that I will feel better and get a little pep in my step. ,I feel like I can talk to anybody. I really don't judge people.  I think that I what helped me in the conversation.  That and I had a really nice lady to talk to.  I always try to find a common ground when meeting and talking to somebody new.  I know one should stay away from religion and politics when meeting somebody new.  It is also said you should not bring up sports.  I don't agree with the last part.  My partner and I got along well because of what we had in common.  We both enjoyed talking about our family and jobs.  We talked of current events and were we live on the map.  I being a sports fan brought that up and it went very well.  Sports can bring people together. ,I am not very good at showing compassion. It is not because I don't want to rather it's just something I am not good at and not comfortable in doing.  For example she talked of health problems and some of the negative side effects because of them.  I tried as best as I could but it is hard for me to show empathy.  I feel it I am just not good in communicating it. ,5.0,6.0,3.0,6.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,3.0,60.0,40.0,7.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,9.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,1.0,5.0,,1.0,1.0,5.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,3.0,4.0,6.0,7.0,8.0,6.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,male,3.0,white,completed_high_school,1.0,,9.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,39.0,5.0,,30.0,0.0,0.0,40.0,30.0,90.0,0.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,5.375,5.333333333333333,1.3333333333333333,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.3333333333333335,3.0,2.3333333333333335,4.666666666666667,3.3333333333333335,1.6666666666666667,4.666666666666667,4.666666666666667,4.0,2.0,work_colleagues,in_person
