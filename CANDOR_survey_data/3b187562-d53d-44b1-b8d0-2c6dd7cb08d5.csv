","I believe the paramount thing that attributed to the conversation was our seemingly similar interests, mindset and curiosity on life events and occasions, and the idea of not dominating the conversation.  We both were able to share an idea and then explain ourselves without the other interrupting or taking over.",There were only a few brief moments where the silent pauses indicated we both did not know where to lead to next--very minor though.  I am also an uncomfortable person speaking with strangers and most likely fidgeted and stuttered quite a bit--probably throwing her off perhaps.
