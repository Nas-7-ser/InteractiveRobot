Another thing that worked well was that we were in similar situations when it came to our overall workload.,"Besides our personal beliefs and workloads, we didn't have much in common. This led to brief periods of silence when we were coming up with topics to talk about. Other than that the conversation was pretty good.

It is going to be busy with work and I hope to make an effort to get outside and take in some fresh air. I need to do meal prep so I know what I am having for meals this week. ,What worked well is we both asked and answered open ended questions. We didn’t ask yes or no questions so it helped moved the conversation along. He was very easy to talk to and I think I am too which made it overall a nice and easy going conversation. I think we had similar interests which also helped. ,What didn’t work as well is a few times we had to ask each other to repeat one another and we had a few awkward silences. But awkward silence wasn’t as awkward as it could have been with a complete stranger since the conversation was going well for the rest of the time. ,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,8.0,8.0,5.0,60.0,40.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,9.0,9.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,22.0,,,4.0,11.0,,,1.0,4.0,7.0,7.0,6.0,3.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,female,2.0,white,bachelors_degree,1.0,,8.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,36.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.25,7.0,,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.3333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,5.0,1.0,4.0,3.3333333333333335,4.0,4.333333333333333,2.0,4.333333333333333,,
