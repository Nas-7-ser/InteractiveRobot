This contrasted pretty heavily to my previous three conversations where my partners definitely felt older and maturer than me, and I felt pressured to act more polite than I would in actuality.","At the beginning I didn't really know what kind of interests she had, so I had to assume we had nothing in common.

He seemed like he really knew what he was doing, as this was his 4th conversation. He was very pleasant and kept the conversation going. He was very knowledgeable and had a lot of interests. ","Sometimes he would go on for a long time when he was talking and I didn't really have a chance to respond to what he was saying. And there was one long pause where I didn't know what to say.
