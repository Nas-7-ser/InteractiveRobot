I hate staring at a screen all day and dread another week of online classes. the weather is getting colder so there will be less and less to do outside.,we had a time limit. This helped us know that we didn't have to keep trying to find things to talk about forever. I think I am pretty good at coming up with questions and trying to keep the conversation going but I still was pretty low energy and bored,she was  very quiet and we did not have much in common. it is very hard to meet a stranger for the first time on zoom and not have any real interactions to reference. it is especially difficult if one or both parties is not very outgoing. holding the brunt of a zoom conversation is exhausting,6.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,7.0,2.0,5.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,2.0,70.0,30.0,3.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,3.0,7.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,12.0,,,4.0,18.0,,,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,6.0,7.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,female,6.0,hispanic_or_latino,some_college,1.0,,8.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,22.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.25,3.0,,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.333333333333333,2.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,3.0,3.6666666666666665,1.6666666666666667,3.3333333333333335,3.0,3.0,3.0,,

We have some fun things planned so I think that will add to the fun times of the week.,We were able to talk about many different things. It seemed like she was good at coming up with more ideas to talk about. I liked that we were both friendly and appeared to be interested in each others lives. We were able to have a normal conversation even though we were strangers.,I am more on the quiet side so sometimes I get shy talking to others so I think this happened to me. I felt a little awkward talking to a stranger and I'm sure she did too.
