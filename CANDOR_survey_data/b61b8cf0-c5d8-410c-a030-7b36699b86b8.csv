I’m going to cook dinner with friends and then maybe go out if we can find a place to go that isn’t closed. Overall I think it will go pretty well. Most of the things i needed to get done are done. It’s just fun left. ,Our conversation went great. She was super friendly and we had a lot in common. We have both spent a lot of time in Portland so we chatted about some of the awesome restaurants in town and some of our favorite experiences there. Overall the conversation went really well. No complaints. ,We didn’t really have any problems. We jumped right in to the conversation and had plenty to talk about the entire time. I literally can’t think of a single thing that was wrong. Of all the conversations I’ve done in the study this was by far the best.

My state is entering another two week covid lockdown... so I don't really anticipate anything out of the ordinary. Mostly just walks with the dog and my inside activities.
Work life might get a bit more stressful. I'm planning a sporting competition and we're encountering some snags with traveler visas and limited flight options.","We had a few shared experiences that we were able to connect on. And after we spoke about those familiar topics, it naturally led to other conversation avenues. For example, I live in Portland and he has family who live here... so we were able to talk about restaurants and the like.","I found that while we had some common experiences, he was slightly more reserved than myself (I tend to think of myself as more outgoing... an introverted extrovert if you will). That led me to feel as though I needed to come up with things to talk about to keep the conversation moving and being engaged. Whether that comes across when you view the footage, I don't know.
