I'll do what I need to do but have fun too.","I think what worked well was that we were both open, nice, and generally warm. There was no bitterness or judgement. We also had some similarities in our location, and what we're studying or did study in college. It was nice to talk about overlapping interests in film and theatre too. ","I think I certainly was a bit tired and not as eager to begin the conversation when it started. I had been coming off a longer day of school and my job. There was a bit of a generational gap since we came from different age groups too, and that was something to navigate.

I have an assignment for work that I am not excited about, so I have been procrastinating. This leads me to feel guilty and work at night in order to catch up. I wish I enjoyed this current assignment more, but I will make the best of it.","My partner was definitely intelligent and capable. We had some things in common, and her interests were fun to hear about. She taught me about a film-rating app called Letterbox that I will check out. And I enjoyed hearing about her tastes in movies and Broadway shows. I was impressed with her vocabulary.","I felt that my partner was less gregarious than me. I was ready to be bubbly and warm, and to share information. She was much more guarded, not volunteering her name, town, university, etc. I felt like we were unbalanced, especially at first.
