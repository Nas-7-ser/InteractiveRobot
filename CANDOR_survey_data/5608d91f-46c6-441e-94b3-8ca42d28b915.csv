My wife is sick.  Fighting with the Department of Children Youth and Family to even be able to see my son.  Have to deal with lawyers, make phone calls and deal with difficult situations.  My life is currently a constant battle.  If it wasn't for my faith in God and my family I don't think I would see any point in going on with the rest of it.","We both found it a little awkward at first.  But when we started talking on a subject, especially towards the end when we felt comfortable enough to open up about decisive subjects like the political scene, things flowed very smoothly.  Basically things went well when we felt safe expressing personal ideas.  ",It was a little slow to get started talking.  Neither of us knew much what to say.  It was like when you meet a person and you are first getting to know them. I usually meet people in groups so there is other conversation to distract and allow me to feel someone out before sharing my convictions.

The only personal plans I have is going trail hiking on Friday afternoon with a few friends if it isn't raining. If it is then we'll go to my house and watch a movie. ","We found a few things we have in common and talked about those. This actually made the conversation far easier and more fluid. We discussed the forest fires in Washington state and California and his work towards becoming an attorney. He also told me about his making extra money playing video games, and the high housing costs in Seattle compared to other places.  ","I really don't think there was anything negative, at least to the point that it affected the conversation. He was using a vape which I thought a little odd but he was in his own home so I didn't ask about it. I'm use to a more professional behavior while on a video call, especially one where I'm being compensated, so I thought it a bit out of place.
