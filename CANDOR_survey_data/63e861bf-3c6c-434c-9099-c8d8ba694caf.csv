",We were both able to talk a lot about the current pandemic since it has affected the both of us for our place of work and school. He asked quite a few questions that were interesting and not too personal to keep the conversation going. He was very polite and nice and it was easy to talk to him in a friendly way. ,"In my opinion, the conversation was a bit awkward. It was hard to find other topics after discussing the pandemic since we naturally didn't have a lot in common being very different ages, gender and industries we work in. There were quite a few awkward pauses between us, and the conversation kept pretty basic.
