Tomorrow I pick up groceries, I'll have to get gas also, and I have one more day of taking my son back and forth to work. Then he's off work for the rest of the week. I'll probably also be doing some online car shopping, so just depending on if I find anything my week could be exciting, or just chill. ","What worked well about my conversation with Christian (sp?) was that we kind of took turns asking each other questions. He was also very nice to give me tips on other survey like sites, and told me about a game he plays that I'm interested in playing. And mostly we just spent the time getting to know each other. ","What didn't work well was at the end when we ran out of things to talk about. You could tell we both felt kind of awkward. We both worked to try and find something else to talk about, but the lapse in conversation was just really awkward a time or two.

I also love coming home to my lovely girlfriend and making dinner for us that is both healthy and nutritious. I then see myself playing some video games as well which is how the rest of my week generally goes during this pandemic. ","I think our like interests and the fact that we both enjoyed similar activities, lended itself to a quality conversation. She was interesting to speak to and was a contrast from myself. I am a lot younger and from a much different part of the nation yet we had a lot of like interests which to me was both interesting and reassuring in a way.",We did not have any issues with connection. The whole video was very smooth and the audio was good. I thought the whole conversation went well up until the 23 minute mark where we both ran out of things to say but we ended up talking about music which although not as interesting still worked in the end. ,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,6.0,9.0,9.0,4.0,35.0,65.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,9.0,9.0,3.0,3.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,4.0,23.0,,,4.0,23.0,,,4.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,5.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,,male,6.0,white,bachelors_degree,7.0,Self employed ,9.0,9.0,2.0,,False,,,23.0,12.0,,0.0,50.0,0.0,50.0,0.0,90.0,0.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,,4.0,,,,5.25,6.666666666666667,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.3333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,4.333333333333333,2.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,2.0,5.0,3.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,romantic_partner,in_person
