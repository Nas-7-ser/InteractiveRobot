I know that we also talked a lot about COVID and what things were like for each of us.",5.0,2.0,6.0,I think towards the end of the conversation we were talking mostly about Trump and how we were both liberal and we both don't really like Biden but we hope that he gets elected because it's embarrassing the way Trump is running the country into the ground. ,3.0,1.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,51.0,3.0,50.0,39.0,5.0,3.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,8.0,9.0,8.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,7.0,8.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,Right now I think that I will do a few more of these if I can do them. I also work as a tutor so I'm going to be tutoring a lot more sessions for the rest of the week. I'm also going to try to eat healthier this week. ,"I think that the conversation worked because we both had the same views about politics and we both saw Trump in the same way, as a sort of crazy uncle. If we held different political views, I don't think that the conversation would have worked but I was surprised she asked about it, to be honest.","I think that it didn't really work because there were a lot of pauses. The woman I was speaking with asked a lot of questions for me to answer and it felt a little bit awkward, like I was giving a job interview, but I'm a people person so I didn't mind answering them but I did feel a bit uncomfortable.",3.0,5.0,9.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,7.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,8.0,3.0,8.0,7.0,9.0,70.0,30.0,5.0,7.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,6.0,9.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4.0,10.0,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,female,6.0,white,bachelors_degree,1.0,,7.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,29.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.625,5.0,,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,3.3333333333333335,5.0,2.3333333333333335,4.666666666666667,2.6666666666666665,2.3333333333333335,2.0,2.0,3.3333333333333335,,

I don't have many plans for the rest of the week so I expect it will be spent working and cleaning up after the roofers who are now making a mess of my yard. I don't have much to say about the upcoming week. That's it.,We both wanted to talk and fill up the space of time. We connected on politics at some points and those points are not difficult to connect on. We were open to talking and making the conversation function on a basic level even though there was nothing at all in common.,We had nothing in common and had to work to find common ground.
