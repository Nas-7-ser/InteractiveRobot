I enjoyed hearing about her life experiences and it's comforting to talk to and have the perspective of an older person. I'm a good listener and she seemed to enjoy talking so that worked. The pace felt pretty good. ",At times it seemed like my conversation partner was talking quite a bit at length without stopping to ask me questions or include me in the conversation but after a while she seemed to circle back with a question to me.
