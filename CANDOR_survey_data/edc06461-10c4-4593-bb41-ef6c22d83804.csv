Other than that, I am staying home to keep from spreading infection. I am hoping that I do get together with my ex-wife. When we saw each other for a few minutes, she said she would like to see me again soon. I was just picking p an item from my son's car but we talked for a bit. It was very nice to see her. Nice to see anyone in person.","At this moment, I wish I had bothered to say his name to him several times. I am out of practice meeting new people. That helps me remember the name. I do not remember his name. What worked really well is he asked me a lot of questions, directing the conversation to what he wanted to hear. I did the same, it was how I initially engaged him. We also just went with it organically to quite an extent. Both of these worked in favor of it.","He seemed a bit shy. Which is why I asked a lot of questions initially. He is very young, which tends to make it so we have less in common. Yet he seemed interested in the things I said that are indicators of my age. My children. A friend died a couple years back.
