But it's really pretty typical other than that.","As it turned out, my partner lives where I was born so we had things to talk about. Also, we both work with computers so we had that to talk about. We also enjoyed trying to figure out what we were supposed to be talking about and what the purpose of this project is.","The video froze a couple of times and it was awkward when the audio did, as well, because we'd sometimes speak over each other and then wouldn't hear what the other person was saying.

Friday appears to be less stressful than Thursday was but I could see my Friday and Saturday being filled with things that I don't care of. Saturday is the Packers game so I am looking forward to that too. Sunday will just be preparation for the next week so rather boring","The fact that we were both from Wisconsin really made the conversation easier because we could play off of that into other aspects of the conversation. In fact, we didn't even introduce ourselves until towards the end because we were so focused on making it to 25 minutes without any awkward pauses.",There was an small audio delay so there were times when we stepped on each other in terms of conversation.
