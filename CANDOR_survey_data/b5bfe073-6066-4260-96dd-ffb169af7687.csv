Just because my personal relationship isn't going so well and that's going to affect everything else.  A supervisor at work said something to me today too that I don't think he meant it for me to take it the way I did, but I took it very badly and it's going to gnaw at my psyche for at least a few weeks most likely.  So, not going to have a great week between my relationship and my supervisor.",She was a good listener and asked pertinent questions to get me talking.  She was attractive too so it was nice talking to an attractive nice person like that.  She seemed to enjoy our conversation and that was helpful because it made me feel comfortable I suppose.  She had a pleasant demeanor.,I feel like I maybe talked too much.  I feel like I didn't maybe ask enough questions to get her talking and instead just kind of talked without showing interest in what her response would be to other questions.

I said my day was good and that I didn't have to work today so that was nice. I asked what he did. He works at a hospital doing food. He inspects the trays before they go out. I said I worked with customers and sometimes they suck.,3.0,3.0,7.0,"He talked about his job and asked about mine. He hadn't heard of the place where I work. I talked about college. He's been really into collecting things. He collects books, mp3s, and videogames, even though he doesn't really read or play video games that much. And who even uses mp3s anymore??? idk not really my business. he's not doing it to use the books just to have them",3.0,3.0,7.0,"He talked about bitcoin. He's been really into it. He's been saving up though, so not really buying it as much. I said I don't know anything about it. We talked about music. He listens to bands that I don't know and vice versa. We talked about my hobbies. We talked about his music collection on his mp3 player.

I am in a good mood and I think I'll be productive on Sunday (rest day Saturday),"I think what worked well is that he had things he was pretty interested in, so he could talk at extent about them. Once I asked a leading question, he would talk about a topic that he was interested in, and then I could just ask vague questions that allowed him to expound on the topic.","He complained a lot at the beginning, which I couldn't really make conversation from. I also thought it was a bit annoying that he was complaining and I didn't really love the whiny tone. I think we are just two very different people, so we didn't have a lot in common.
