At work I'm probably going to get more hours because a previous coworker ended up breaking his arm.  So I'm not going to have much time off. Just working and relaxing. Just like I've always done. ,I can't be specific. I guess it's just that we both had a good attitude going into the conversation and didn't really know what to expect. Both knew how to carry a conversation as well. because at least me personally there wasn't a dead spot in the conversation. there was something that we could always talk and relate about. ,The only problems that we had was just from me where i couldn't keep a stable internet connection to save my life. My internet went out so i switched to a hot spot. Then my hot spot decided to go out and i switched back to my internet and that helped a bit. ,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,9.0,9.0,5.0,60.0,40.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,7.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,25.0,,,4.0,25.0,,,4.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,,,,male,3.0,hispanic_or_latino,some_college,1.0,,8.0,9.0,2.0,,False,,,28.0,10.0,,10.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,90.0,80.0,0.0,10.0,10.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,4.0,,,,6.25,7.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.6666666666666667,4.333333333333333,2.3333333333333335,2.3333333333333335,3.0,3.6666666666666665,5.0,4.333333333333333,2.3333333333333335,4.333333333333333,other,in_person

I'll be finishing up some work for class and then chilling this weekend. I'm feeling stressed because I'm a little behind and quarantine has been stressing me out. Hopefully, I will be able to watch some shows and finish some series. ","He was super open and wanted to talk. I didn't feel like I needed to pry anything out of him. He was very interested in sharing and talking, so it seemed to flow really well. I think I was responsive to his interests and listened to everything he said. It was overall pretty good. ","His tone of voice was a little dull. Like, he came off as dull and a little slow-talking. Since I tend to be more fast-paced, I found that to be a little dry sometimes. It was better when it seemed like he was actually vibing or interested, but he was mostly just monotone and dull.
