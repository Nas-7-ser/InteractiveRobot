I have some to get done but I imagine it will go fine. Hopefully I’m going to have some free time and go for a walk or something of the sort to get some exercise and fresh air. Then later this week I get to go visit family. ,Everything went well. My partner had some questions prepared which was helpful. We found some interesting things to talk about. He is pretty passionate about some of his hobbies which was nice since it gave us some stuff to talk about. He asked lots of questions too which made it easy to find things to talk about. ,We are in very different places in life so it was intitially a little hard to find things we had in common but over all it wasn’t that big of an obstacle to get around. Since we were trying to find things to talk about it there were some long pauses but overall we found stuff eventually. ,5.0,5.0,8.0,7.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,5.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,50.0,50.0,4.0,3.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,7.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,,1.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,9.0,6.0,8.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,male,4.0,white,bachelors_degree,1.0,,8.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,39.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.75,6.0,,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.6666666666666665,3.0,4.666666666666667,1.3333333333333333,3.0,2.6666666666666665,4.0,2.0,3.3333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,,

I think I will learn some new things, spend time with family, and take care of responsibilities. I think there will be times where I am anxious or nervous but I will deal with those feelings in a positive way and get passed them.",I think the conversation went well because we both had a casual attitude and didn't try to force things. I think it helped that both of us spoke honestly about our lives and listened to what the other person had to say. We treated each other as equals but didn't take things too seriously and tried to have fun with it.,One thing I think didn't work well was that sometimes there were lulls in the conversation and that led to slight amounts of awkwardness. Neither of us were interested in many similar things which may have limited our input on certain subjects and made it harder to relate to eachother.,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,4.0,60.0,40.0,6.0,4.0,6.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,7.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,2.0,,4.0,20.0,,,3.0,5.0,3.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,6.0,8.0,7.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,male,2.0,white,some_college,2.0,,8.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,20.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.125,5.666666666666667,,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.6666666666666665,1.6666666666666667,1.3333333333333333,2.3333333333333335,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.3333333333333335,2.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,,
