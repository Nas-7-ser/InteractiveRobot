It isnt going to be too busy since work has been slow but I am glad I get to spend more time with my son. At least it wont be as hot outside so we can enjoy time at the park. ,It seemed asking questions and trying to find common ground worked well. Some people just like to talk about themselves and its always good to be a good listener. I feel I have a good ear and can listen to alot of stories that people like to share with others. ,When trying to find common ground sometimes you find out you dont have much in common and then the conversation can be a dead end. Also when you talk about things the other person knows nothing about then that is tough. Those two things really dont work well and didnt work for us.,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,7.0,9.0,7.0,7.0,30.0,70.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,6.0,9.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,25.0,,,5.0,,2.0,,1.0,3.0,4.0,7.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,8.0,7.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,female,4.0,white,bachelors_degree,1.0,,9.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,29.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.875,6.333333333333333,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.666666666666667,5.0,5.0,2.3333333333333335,2.6666666666666665,4.333333333333333,5.0,5.0,1.0,3.6666666666666665,,

I have to do a presentation this week for a senior staff meeting and i'm looking forward to it but it means that there is a lot of preparation that I have in front of me. I am in a good mood this week because I just moved apartments with my girlfriend. We are really happy to be living in the same apartment together. It gives us lots to do during this time. Covid and being quarantined has been hard but being able to focus on something like setting up the apartment will take our minds off of all the bad stuff. We can focus on other things now. The rest of the week I am going to try to make some yummy food dishes and just enjoy the sunny weather with my girlfriend. I am sad that summer is almost over. ,The conversation was alright in that we didn't have too many awkward pauses but in general I just didn't have a feeling that we had too much in common. I felt like I was leading the conversation most of the time but I didn't mind that. It was a nice opportunity to talk about a few things going in my life. It was pleasant to hear a few things about a strangers life right now especially because I think we are all living in bubbles during quarantine. It has been so long since i've had a conversation with a stranger so I really enjoyed that aspect of things. I think that overall it was a pleasant conversation even though we didn't continue the conversation too long after the required 25 minutes. I thought that my speaking partner was an all around good person and that definitely showed through in our conversation. ,The conversation wasn't that great because I just don't think we were really that compatible. I can't exactly put my finger on it but we just didn't vibe that well. Its hard to think about what else to say because I really think it was that simple. She was a nice person but just not someone that I would be friendly with. I think it was in the content of what we talked about--we didn't ever really get past surface level conversation. Maybe I am expecting too much from a 25 minute conversation. I think that the fact that she talked about how much she liked living in southern virginia and the fact that I am living in new york city also lead to us not connecting. I think we just live very different lives. It is hard to imagine living on 2 acres of land when I live in a tiny apartment with no land. ,5.0,5.0,7.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,4.0,7.0,4.0,7.0,3.0,6.0,8.0,3.0,75.0,25.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,6.0,1.0,7.0,9.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,10.0,,,4.0,8.0,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,male,4.0,white,masters_degree,1.0,,8.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,31.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.625,5.0,2.3333333333333335,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.666666666666667,4.0,3.6666666666666665,2.0,4.666666666666667,1.3333333333333333,4.666666666666667,2.3333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,2.0,,
