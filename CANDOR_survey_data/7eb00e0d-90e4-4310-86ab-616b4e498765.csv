The last guy he did a chat with worked at an expensive art gallery and that's all they talked about for entire time.,7.0,7.0,8.0,We talked about how I visited my sister in California last October since he also lives in California. I told him how shocked I was that there were so many cars and people everywhere. We spent so much time driving around it wasn't even fun.,8.0,8.0,9.0,We talked about how about 70% of his family lives in Mexico and how far it is to go and visit them. He said that the place where they grow a lot of avocadoes is really fancy and expensive (I had no idea!). We both agreed that we need to get into the avocado industry!,6.0,6.0,8.0,9.0,9.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,72.0,4.0,84.0,69.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,1.0,7.0,6.0,8.0,9.0,8.0,9.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,6.0,8.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,7.0,8.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,6.0,I see it going very smoothly because the week is almost over! It's Thursday today and the day is already halfway over. I only have one or two tasks I really want to get done or mostly done before this week is over: making or at least starting to make my kids' Halloween costumes and clean the house for my dad visiting on Saturday morning.,"What worked especially well was the ability for both of us to lead off what each other had just said previously and turn that into another lead for a conversation. So I would talk about weather and he would ask what weather is in my area. He lives in California, which led to me talking about my sister that also lives there.","We had a couple times where neither of us wanted to talk first so then it would be a little awkward, but then we both tried to talk at the same time, so one of us would have to say, ""No, you go first!"" or ""Oops, you go.""

Im getting a new phone right now so that's a big positive for me. im interviewing this old lady on friday about her age and mental health and shes been interesting so far to talk to because she was a part of the black panthers and im looking forward to her finishing telling me her story ,what worked well is that we both went into the conversation with a positive mindset. also surprisingly I've been paired with some pretty liberal midwesterners through this program i would've expected to have been paired with some conservatives. That would've been super awkward when i start talking about electric cars and they're like i don't believe any of that hippie stuff lmao ,I felt like i interrupted her way more than i had interrupted the partners i had in my previous talks that i had with this study. Im not sure why i interrupted her i also felt like in this one we were both a lot more scared of having any silence so as soon as any of us thought there was going to be a silence we both came up with a question or something,9.0,9.0,5.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,9.0,9.0,5.0,40.0,60.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,9.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,,2.0,,4.0,25.0,,,4.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,7.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,male,6.0,hispanic_or_latino,masters_degree,1.0,,10.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,28.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.75,7.0,1.0,1.0,25.0,18.0,13.0,2.0,2.0,13.0,3.3333333333333335,5.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,4.666666666666667,4.666666666666667,2.3333333333333335,4.666666666666667,,
