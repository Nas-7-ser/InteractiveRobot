Other than that, I will probably be mostly playing games or maybe do a few gig economy tasks for some extra spending money.  I hopefully will not be doing anything related to my main job since I'm supposed to be off enjoying some time off.",We seemed to be both pretty good about listening to each other on different topics.  It felt like we weren't too different in terms of our perspective on life even when there were some obvious differences between us in terms of children and employment types.  We had a pretty reasonable discussion on politics after I was initially unsure how that as a topic would be received since it tends to be a divisive topic but so relevant at the moment.,"While I mostly think it went well, I think we struggled at times to have a progression of topics with where we were at and where we wanted to go with the conversation.  In particular, climate topics aren't really my thing, but we ended up talking about weather for more than I had bargained for during the conversation.",3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,3.0,60.0,40.0,3.0,6.0,7.0,3.0,2.0,8.0,8.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,7.0,,,4.0,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,7.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,male,2.0,white,masters_degree,1.0,,9.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,39.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,5.666666666666667,,1.6666666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.3333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,4.666666666666667,3.3333333333333335,5.0,1.3333333333333333,4.0,4.666666666666667,2.3333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,,

Definitely enough to keep us going for the whole 25 minutes and it only seemed as though 15 may have passed. We enjoyed talking about research for a bit and then spent lots of time speaking about the election which was very enjoyable.
