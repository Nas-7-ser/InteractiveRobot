However, to keep things flowing, I tried to ask questions about my partner so he could talk about himself, which seemed to be the only topic he was interested in. He wasn’t openly hostile, so I suppose that is a positive aspect.","This was not the most pleasant or naturally-flowing conversation. My partner sat in silence, waiting for me to lead and initiate each conversation. My partner frequently interrupted me, whether I was asking a question or bringing up a new topic.
