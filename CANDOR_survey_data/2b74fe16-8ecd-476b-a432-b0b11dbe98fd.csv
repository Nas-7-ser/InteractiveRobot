She liked to talk a lot about herself so it was very easy on my end to just listen. She also seemed to have questions pre thought out to help keep it going. Overall she was friendly and laughed a lot so it was a pleasant exchange.,My partner tended to try and dominate the conversation. At times when I tried to steer the conversation to another topic she would switch it back to talking about her dog.
