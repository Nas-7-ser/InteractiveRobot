I am both feeling excited and nervous, but I am looking forward to the trip. I will find myself very busy over the nexxt several days getting ready for the trip, but I will also find as much time as possible to play with my son and have some fun, not to mention getting some exercise.","I really enjoyed how we were able to share our opinions openly and honestly without judging one another, and on some very potentially sensitive issues no less. I felt like I could have an open and intelligent conversation with my partner and share with her in ways I couldn't do with most other people. We may not have always agreed, but we did not try to belittle one another either, which was a refreshing change from so many other conversations with people, especially strangers.","We did both tend to interrupt each other a bit, I think myself a little worse, which probably detracted from the conversation a little. I could also hear myself echoing through her speakers which was a little distracting, although not enough to be that big of a deal. In addition, there was a little bit of a barrier with regard to her accent, which was a bit thick and difficult to understand at times. I could understand almost everything that she said, but not quite all, and I had to focus in on it a lot more to be able to understand.",5.0,7.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,55.0,45.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,,2.0,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,female,3.0,white,bachelors_degree,2.0,,8.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,36.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.875,6.0,,1.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.3333333333333335,2.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,2.3333333333333335,3.0,4.333333333333333,3.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,2.3333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,,
