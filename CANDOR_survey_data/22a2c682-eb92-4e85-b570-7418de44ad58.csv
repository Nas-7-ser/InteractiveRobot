My conversation with Cris made me feel positive about myself and us learning about one another's lives. Being able to be open about our emotional and mental states during this pandemic gives me a positive feeling about the upcoming weekend.,Both my conversation partner and I were able to easily continue the conversation and talks about various topics going on in our lives and throughout the United States. We constantly asked one another personal questions or congratulated one another on our accomplishments which fostered a friendly environment without judgment. Both of us waited for one another to speak and seemed to enjoyed one another's company during this study. ,"There were a few times I seemed to have stumbled over my partner attempting to finish their sentence, but that may have been my audio cutting out for a brief second on my end. Otherwise, I felt the conversation went extremely well and the video did not lag and everything on the technical side of our conversation seemed to work very well.",4.0,7.0,5.0,7.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,8.0,9.0,9.0,6.0,48.0,52.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,8.0,9.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,,1.0,1.0,5.0,,1.0,1.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,3.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,male,6.0,white,some_college,1.0,,7.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,26.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6.375,6.666666666666667,,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.3333333333333335,4.666666666666667,4.333333333333333,3.0,4.666666666666667,4.0,4.666666666666667,5.0,2.3333333333333335,5.0,,

It's possible that we will go into another lockdown here and my wife, who is a librarian, might have her branch shut down as part of that. Our anniversary is tomorrow so it'd be nice to spend more time with her. Otherwise, I think things will likely go well within my life overall.","My conversation partner was very personable, and even though we both have different backgrounds, I think that we both found common knowledge and interests quickly. He was very personable and intelligent and understood things well. We had a good cadence during the conversation that seemed natural and respectful. I thought we got along well from the very beginning.","I am not sure I know of something that didn't go well. I have some pretty manageable ADD so I tend to notice that I inadvertently talk a bit over people. It's not bad and I am very much aware of it, but I still wonder if that annoys others or if they don't mind.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,7.0,5.0,8.0,8.0,5.0,55.0,45.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,4.0,5.0,,1.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,male,4.0,white,masters_degree,7.0,Freelancer,8.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,46.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,5.375,6.333333333333333,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,3.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,5.0,3.3333333333333335,4.0,3.6666666666666665,4.333333333333333,4.0,,
