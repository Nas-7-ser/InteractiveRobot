I think we are celebrating by drinking heavily and enjoying each other's company. This will most likely be extremely fun because it usually is even when we don't have a reason to celebrate.,I think the fact that we had similar beliefs in the presidential election meant it was a good conversation to have. We got to express our opinions to each other without the feeling that one is judging the other which led to a smooth conversation. How intelligent she seemed to be also worked well.,I also think that the fact that we had such similar opinions on the election meant that we did not challenge each other for having an opposing opinion. I like conversations like that because it can lead to one of the people having a new enlighten opinion on different matters. ,5.0,6.0,4.0,7.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,8.0,8.0,3.0,60.0,40.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,7.0,6.0,5.0,7.0,6.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,1.0,5.0,,1.0,1.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,male,4.0,black_or_african_american,bachelors_degree,1.0,,6.0,6.0,2.0,,False,,,26.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6.0,6.0,,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.6666666666666665,3.0,2.6666666666666665,3.0,3.6666666666666665,2.3333333333333335,4.0,3.6666666666666665,2.0,3.3333333333333335,,

I received my biopsy results I was worried about today and it was the best possible outcome! I have the weekend technically ""off"" from work but do usually do some work. There is less pressure on me if I don't do as much work as I plan to though, and I feel less guilt, so Im excited for the weekend. ","It was very easy for us to continue the conversation without any gaps or awkward pauses. Kobe was a great conversation partner, and we had similar views on things, so it was easy for the conversation to take off. It was nice to talk to someone who was in DC during everything going on and see how that impacted their opinions on things I care about. ","We both were really excited about what we were talking about which meant that at times we were overlaping in conversation or accidentally cutting each other off.
