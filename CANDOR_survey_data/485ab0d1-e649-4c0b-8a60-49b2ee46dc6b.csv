I probably won't get much free time to myself. I have a few appointments to go to ans hopefully will start looking for another job. Hopefully the stock market will turn around by the end of the week.,"She was full of energy and seemed to really like small talk, so she kept the conversation going even though I was tired. We had plenty to talk about due to recent current events, and she had her move and things with her husband to share. She was pro-social and seemed to enjoy chatting with people in general.","Not knowing each other or having a similar lifestyle, we did not have things in common to get excited about, or at least not that were immediately apparent. I'm more of an independent, single, city girl, and she was more of a family lady into country life. She seemed like she was interested in what came on the TV, and I see TV as outdated technology that gives you only a narrow point of view.",8.0,7.0,8.0,3.0,4.0,9.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,15.0,85.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,2.0,,4.0,15.0,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,8.0,7.0,8.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,female,6.0,white,masters_degree,1.0,,6.0,9.0,2.0,,False,,,38.0,8.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,100.0,0.0,100.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.625,6.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.6666666666666665,2.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,2.6666666666666665,4.333333333333333,4.333333333333333,4.333333333333333,3.3333333333333335,1.6666666666666667,2.0,work_colleagues,in_person

They are drilling our well and we have to go through additional permitting.  We are a bit anxious about it all as it is taking much longer than anticipated.  We are excited that the vegetables we planted are growing fast.,The audio was reverbing so she was having a difficult time understanding me.  This caused the conversation to be a bit akward.  It worked well that I was a bit more awake and was asking questions as she was still having her coffee.  It was nice to speak to someone who is actually in the the epicenter of the coronavirus.,"She wasn't as open as me, so I had to ask most of the questions.  Once we had a chance to speak, it flowed a bit better but not too good because of the audio reverbing.  I always am excited to speak and I felt like she just was showing up to check a box.",4.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,8.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,2.0,65.0,35.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,7.0,5.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,19.0,,,4.0,5.0,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,female,4.0,white,bachelors_degree,1.0,,3.0,6.0,2.0,,False,,,40.0,10.0,,20.0,30.0,15.0,35.0,0.0,20.0,30.0,40.0,10.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.5,5.0,2.0,2.6666666666666665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.333333333333333,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.333333333333333,1.6666666666666667,3.6666666666666665,4.0,3.6666666666666665,2.6666666666666665,work_colleagues,phone_call
