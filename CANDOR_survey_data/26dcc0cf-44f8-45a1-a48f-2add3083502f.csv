He won't get better, they are just trying to keep him comfortable and he's on the strongest antibiotics on the market.  Sometimes I constantly check my email for good surveys, keeping up on household tasks, taking care of the pets, grocery and other shopping.  I always have something to do...",He's currently in Chicago and I use to live there.  It was interesting that he worked in the medical field.  I wanted more info on what he was getting into but I just kept blabbing.  I really tried to get out of this foggy mood I was in.  I felt a bit inconsistent and forgetful. He seems like really nice guy.,I was foggy even though I tried to prepare myself for it by talking with a friend for a bit.  Last time I was talkative and I felt that I was forcing it this time.  It's hard to literally schedule meeting new people for me I guess. I more or less act on how I feel and I haven't been 100% today after a busy day yesterday and it's gloomy outside.,7.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,8.0,3.0,4.0,9.0,3.0,70.0,30.0,7.0,6.0,1.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,9.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,7.0,,,4.0,7.0,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,9.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,,,,female,4.0,white,some_college,5.0,,,,2.0,,False,,,41.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.125,6.333333333333333,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,4.0,4.333333333333333,4.666666666666667,3.3333333333333335,4.333333333333333,4.333333333333333,3.6666666666666665,4.666666666666667,,

I have work from Tuesday until Friday only which is a relief for me as I had worked ten days straight before today. I have a few meetings and side tasks that I need to do (such as completing my research publication or working on figuring out how to do taxes) but I feel like I have a good amount of time to get things done.,Things that worked well included figuring out what commonalities my conversation partner and I had together. I tried to bring up topics like pets and living in Chicago as opportunities for us to get to know one another better. Another thing that worked well is that we were both fairly open to asking each other questions and being open to answering them as well!,"I think that, even though the majority of our conversation was focused on topics related to things we had in common, the quantity of these topics were limited. We had very different lives leading to today and so I was worried that our conversation could potentially fall short or flat. This made me feel anxious as I was sometimes worrying about what questions I should ask next to continue the conversation",7.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,7.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,40.0,60.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,6.0,6.0,9.0,9.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,25.0,,,5.0,,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,7.0,2.0,9.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,,male,4.0,asian,professional_degree,1.0,,,,2.0,,False,,,28.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.5,5.666666666666667,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.3333333333333335,4.0,4.0,2.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,4.0,2.3333333333333335,2.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,,
