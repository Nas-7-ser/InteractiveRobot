Looking forward to unwind. The next week should be rather eventful. I am going to be onboarding a new team member. That will be rather interesting since he is going to be my senior. All in all, I am looking forward to the weekend and the next week.","In general, the exchange was fairly balanced. Initially, she asked a lot of general and good, open-ended questions.  I feel I responded well and then she returned the response. It was a pleasant experience overall. There wasn't a lot of silence and we were able to talk about things that are either relevant to us or overall interesting topics. ","Although I stated earlier that the exchange was overall balanced and I still maintain that to be true, I feel that some of her answers were a little short. Maybe I talked too much or I don't know. Although she was carrying the conversation and she came up with the questions, I feel that her answers to the questions were a little less revealing.

I haven't been out much since coronavirus and I haven't seen any of my friends.  I have enough food and drink that I don't need to leave my house.  I will watch TV and stay in my bed all weekend.,The conversation worked well because we were both originally from Europe and we had both married American people.  He was impressed I could say two words in his mother tongue because not many people know it.  We were both in New York City and he was familiar with the area I lived in.,"I didn't feel like there was enough variation in conversation.  I feel like I was waiting for a moment to interject.
