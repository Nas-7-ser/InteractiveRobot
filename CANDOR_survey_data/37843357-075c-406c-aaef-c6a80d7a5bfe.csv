I recommended a browser extension to her so she can do more surveys.,5.0,5.0,5.0,We talked about how restrictions for COVID differ between our two states. She also mentioned she had two kids and that she's at home with them right now.,7.0,7.0,8.0,"We talked about different TV shows that we've been watching.

The beginning of the week is usually the toughest for me since I have the majority of my classes during this time. Once that's over I usually feel pretty relieved and can go about the rest of the week with a lot less stress.,I think we both did our best to focus on things we had in common. Talking about TV shows at the end was great because we could talk about ones we both have seen and recommend things to one another based on that. I think that brought more of a personal aspect to the conversation.,"There were times where it felt like there was dead air and we were not totally sure what to say. Certain parts of the conversation did not necessarily flow together, so transitions were kind of abrupt and not every subject was connected to the others. I probably spoke over her a couple times when trying to fill that gap.",5.0,6.0,3.0,7.0,4.0,2.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,7.0,5.0,8.0,3.0,70.0,30.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,7.0,9.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,25.0,,,4.0,25.0,,,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,male,6.0,white,some_college,7.0,Student,10.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,21.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.75,5.666666666666667,,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,4.666666666666667,4.333333333333333,1.3333333333333333,4.333333333333333,3.6666666666666665,3.0,4.0,,

We talked a lot about shows on Netflix. We talked about shows like Schitt's Creek, Game of Thrones, Avatar: The Last Airbender and The Legend of Korra. We talked A LOT about those, recalling those shows again and remembering what they were about. We also recommended some shows to each other. ",7.0,5.0,7.0,"Towards the end, we talked about sports and music. He said that he liked to play soccer, watch soccer and play Fifa. Then we talked about musical instruments that we both played.

I think it should be an okay week. I don't really think ahead much about how it will go. To be honest, I just take things as they go. I've learned in life that plans will change very often. I feel that I often just end up going with the flow of things. I guess I am just a really boring person.","So talking about movies and shows was actually a really good thing to do. I wasn't sure if I could connect with him on any other levels, especially with the short time that we had. It worked well that he was talkative because I am often not good at making conversation. So that was one thing that really worked.","I'm sure that I was the negative factor in the conversation. I struggle with communicating and I get nervous. If I didn't get nervous and anxious, the conversation would probably a lot better. I couldn't really think of much to say. I also don't think that we had much in common, so we had to focus on surface things, like TV shows.
