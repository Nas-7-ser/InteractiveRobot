I think we were open about sharing things about our personal lives enough to relate to one another and keep the conversation going. It definitely didn't feel like 25 minutes.","I was a little unfocused I think at times, because I had just gotten to sit down for the first time today and was really centered on unpacking and unwinding my own stuff so I don't think I was the best listener and that maybe I dominated the conversation a little bit.",1.0,4.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,8.0,4.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,7.0,5.0,60.0,40.0,6.0,2.0,2.0,7.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,2.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,female,3.0,white,masters_degree,1.0,,8.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,30.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.625,6.0,,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.3333333333333335,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,2.3333333333333335,4.0,3.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,4.333333333333333,,
