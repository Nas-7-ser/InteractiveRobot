We also both were located fairly close to each other in geographic location. We had some similarities around interests primarily with regards to running and an interest in the Olympics. ,I think I blathered on a bit more than I should have. I went on a tangent to something he brought up and sort of made it all about me. I think I may have went slightly political when I should not have.
