I need to prepare for a trial and included in that is conducting research on legal issues regarding virtual jury selection.  I am also expecting a new head boss to come into the office tomorrow so it will be a busy week.,I think everything worked well.  We were both respectful of each other and I thought his story was very good to hear.  He told me some of the struggles he's had dealing with cerebral palsy but he still carries on with his life and it was very inspiring to hear.,There truly was not anything that did not work well in our conversation.  Everything flowed well between topics and it was like we knew each other for longer than just a twenty five minute timed session.  He is a very admirable person and I applaud that he has such a positive attitude despite what he's had to deal with in life.,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,3.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,8.0,9.0,5.0,50.0,50.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,8.0,8.0,9.0,9.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,,1.0,4.0,5.0,,1.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,8.0,6.0,9.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,male,2.0,white,professional_degree,1.0,,8.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,28.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.5,6.666666666666667,,2.6666666666666665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.666666666666667,4.333333333333333,4.666666666666667,1.6666666666666667,4.0,3.6666666666666665,4.666666666666667,3.6666666666666665,1.6666666666666667,4.0,,
