As mentioned in the conversation I have yet to get my stimulus check and it has been almost 8 weeks since I initially applied for UI/RA here in Florida and have yet to receive any monies.  I have a big bill due by the 21st and have no idea how I'm going to be able to pay that without begging more and more from family & friends.  I have recently moved into a new apartment, having to beg money to do so, and the initial payment I made will also shortly run out.  I think the guy will be lenient and open to waiting, but I'm also getting off the subject.  I have faced a lot of depression and anxiety in the last two weeks since being here in the apartment so have still not done the cleaning I should be doing nor have a I fully moved.  So the rest of the week will involve the stress of continuing to fight with FL UI/RA along with trying to find the motivation to finally give this place a good cleaning and fully unpack, but with the stress and feeling that perhaps I shouldn't unpack because I might have to leave in the next couple of weeks.","I think the conversation worked well on many levels.  Firstly, at least in my case, the pairing of a male & female can ease the conversation jitters a bit.  Next, there is a bit of freedom knowing you are talking to a perfect stranger that you are not likely to ever encounter again, allowing one to feel more able to express themselves without fear of reprisal, which doesn't happen often here in FL if you're a liberal.  Finally, the fact that the COVID-19 crisis is on everyone's minds leads to a natural discussion topic that can lead to other more personal conversations.","The quality of her video was definitely not up to snuff for my technical considerations but am unaware of how I looked to her, I should have asked.  I was able to hear her quite well but she had many occasions where she couldn't hear or understand me quite well.  For the most part I think it was because her children were in the house and doing what children do, but I think there might have also been a small language barrier as she is Italian born and you could still detect an accent.  Had her environment been much quieter I'm not sure there would have been any issues.  Overall the conversation worked well and the video artifacting did not change the nature of the conversation.  I do not specifically remember any actual lag, although there were times it seemed my audio was not reaching her as immediately as it could.  As someone who has not done a lot of video conferencing, but have participated in Telemedicine sessions I was not surprised by the overall experience.",5.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,6.0,3.0,7.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,7.0,3.0,8.0,8.0,3.0,60.0,40.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,9.0,9.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,,,4.0,20.0,,,4.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,7.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,male,4.0,white,bachelors_degree,3.0,,10.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,48.0,1.0,,0.0,0.0,100.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,0.0,90.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,7.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,,4.0,,,,4.75,5.666666666666667,,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.3333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,1.6666666666666667,4.666666666666667,4.666666666666667,3.0,4.0,3.6666666666666665,3.0,4.666666666666667,friends,phone_call

My kids are almost finished with their school year, so I am happy homeschooling is coming to an end.
I am looking forward to Memorial Day weekend so I have more tome to spend with my family even though we will not have any friends over this here.
","I think I didn't have much in common with my partner but we did have a pleasant conversation on the coronavirus and how it has affected our lives. I think this common ground helped us have a plesant conversation for over half an hour. We also are both from Florida, but apart from that we didn't have much more common ground.",I can't say it didn't work out because the conversation was pleasant and we both contributed to it fairly equally. My partner was very kind and was genuinely interested in hearing my point of view as was I of hearing his.
