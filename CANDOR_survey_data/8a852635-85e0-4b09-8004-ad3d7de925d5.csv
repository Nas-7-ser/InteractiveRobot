It won't be as stressful as the weeks in the past have been because I will have fewer classes starting Monday. I will have more time to get my prep work and grading done for my classes. And I will have more time to relax and enjoy some free time.,"The conversation flowed pretty naturally. We didn't really have many lulls in the conversation. We had plenty of topics to talk about without it being awkward. We also had a lot in common as we are both teachers, so that meant we had a lot of things to talk about especially in a pandemic.","We sometimes talked over one another, so that was the biggest issue. Other than that, we didn't really have any other issues or difficulties. We both had a lot to say, so it was sometimes hard to get a word in.

I know that Covid will make things tough, but that we will get through it. ","We were both sports fans, that also liked working with learners. Our shared careers made it very easy to talk about life and about our current jobs. Since we both avoided politics and religion, we were able to focus on things that were not contentious. We both listened to each other and made sure that each person was able to talk. ",There were a couple of times where we were at a loss for words. We didn't get into a deep talk but stuck to rather safe conversations. That is understandable considering were just met. I think deeper conversations could be had if participants spoke to each other more than once.
