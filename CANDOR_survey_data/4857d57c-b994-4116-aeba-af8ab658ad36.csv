I have to go to the dentist on Monday and it's overshadowing even my Mother's Day tomorrow! It's possible a dental surgery depending on the x-rays -not just a filling-so that's why I'm dreading it and being a baby.  Other than that my week will consist of NOT GOING ANYWHERE like all the previous weeks so life is fairly uneventful and dull right now.,"This guy Ray was 28 years old and probably expected someone much younger than myself. Poor guy! He's probably thinking OH my GOD, they set me up with my Mother!!  But actually we had a lot of fun talking. He is just slightly older than my oldest son so I can relate to him quite well and I found him to be very sweet and funny and I enjoyed our conversation very much.","Honestly I felt it worked really well. I enjoyed it a lot. I guess our age difference would be something that ideally ""didn't work well""--I mean probably mostly for him. He was probably hoping to meet the girl of his dreams perhaps and instead he gets a woman who could very easily be his mother. But he was very gracious about it and treated me like a regular person and not like an elderly woman, to his credit!

I will give it my best energy to not let things stress me out in order for me to have a really good week. That is all. Thank you ,I think what worked well was the flow of the conversation and the fact that we are open minded. We seem to be good people and we let each other finish sentences. Not interrupting each other. She was not a rude person and she is a good listener as well. I think all of those things helped.,The only thing I can think of that didnt work well was the amount of time we had to talk to each other. I personally am not good at face to face conversations especially with a stranger. So I would have the next question ready in case there was an awkward silence.,4.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,3.0,60.0,40.0,6.0,2.0,6.0,5.0,8.0,9.0,9.0,7.0,5.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,5.0,,1.0,1.0,5.0,,1.0,1.0,2.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,9.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,,,,male,2.0,hispanic_or_latino,some_college,1.0,,9.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,29.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.375,6.666666666666667,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.3333333333333335,5.0,5.0,1.0,3.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,4.0,4.333333333333333,1.3333333333333333,5.0,,
