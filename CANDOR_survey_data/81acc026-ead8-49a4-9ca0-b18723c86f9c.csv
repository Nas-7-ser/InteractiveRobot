We both used survey websites, both used reddit for information, and we both had similar ideas on politics. On top of that, we were both gun owners and enjoyed using them for fun and sport. All of these factors helped the conversation go well
","There was somewhat of an age difference, with me being younger. If I was a little older, its possible we would have been able to connect even more. On top of that, my partner was very vocal about politics right off the bat. While I happened to agree with him, it would have been easy for me to be on the other side of the belief system
