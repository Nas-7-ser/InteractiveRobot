They mentioned that they've been cooking more and we talked about baking.

I think we mentioned that we were both unemployed at the start.,7.0,5.0,7.0,"We talked about college and out degrees. They had a dual major in physics and gender studies.

I don't have much planned and that worries me a bit because I don't want to end up bored with nothing to do since it would make me bored. I'm hoping to hear good news back from my job search. I'd say overall I feel hopeful.,"I think what worked well with the conversation is that we found a shared struggle that we were both facing that we could talk about, that being our difficulty finding a job out of college in the current situation. I also think the conversation went well because again we were both trying to have a conversation and dedicated the time for it. I think were it not for that our conversation would have ended earlier.","I think what didn't work as well was I got the impression that neither of us were super outgoing people. So there were pauses in the conversation because neither of us had something to talk about but we would both try to keep the conversation going regardless. I also felt a little bad if we said something at the same time, they seemed apologetic for it though they didn't need to be.",5.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,8.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,60.0,40.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,8.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,15.0,,,4.0,15.0,,,5.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,2.0,6.0,6.0,8.0,4.0,7.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,male,4.0,white,bachelors_degree,2.0,,8.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,23.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.5,6.0,,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,3.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,2.0,4.0,1.6666666666666667,4.333333333333333,3.3333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,,

They seemed to have a few questions prepared--maybe they planned them beforehand? or simply thought of them during the conversation.

My partner also seemed pleasant. A little socially awkward, but so am I. I am familiar with socially awkward people, too, so it actually felt a bit reassuring.","There were sometimes where we had breaks in the conversation without much development. There were a few times where I dropped the momentum or where I started to get caught up in emotions, too.

Also, I feel like I sometimes took up more of the time. I tend to ask people a lot of questions, and I feel like I probably asked more questions of them then they did of me.
