","I think we were both very engaged in the conversation. We both did a pretty good job of letting the conversation flow, whether it be current events or his children, we talked about whatever came to mind and we weren't shy about any details. It was nice to talk to someone anonymous and open up about some details in my life!","I don't think there were too many things that didn't work well. It is always a little awkward at the beginning of meeting someone you've never seen before, but this was almost as good as it's ever gotten for me.
