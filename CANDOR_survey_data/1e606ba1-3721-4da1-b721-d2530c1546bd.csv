I am a graduate student and it is midterm week so I have a lot of grading that I have to do. Today is going to be busy as well because I have to go to work at Walgreens just to come back home and work my tutoring job,What worked well was that we both asked each other questions. We were genuinely interested in the things we had to say. We were both also pretty active listeners. I think in order to ask a real question you have to be paying attention to what the other person is saying and ask follow up questions about their life and stuff like that. ,"I dont really know that there are many things that didnt work. It never felt awkward, I never felt uncomfortable and even when it got to the end I was ready to leave but not because I felt like the conversation had come to a natural end but because I have to get my day started and am a bit tired ",4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,9.0,4.0,60.0,40.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,9.0,9.0,3.0,3.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,4.0,4.0,25.0,,,2.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,female,4.0,black_or_african_american,masters_degree,1.0,,4.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,25.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.5,6.0,2.0,2.0,30.0,6.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,12.0,5.0,3.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,2.6666666666666665,3.0,2.0,4.666666666666667,4.0,2.3333333333333335,4.0,,

Still with all this considered there will probably be large sums of time not doing anything productive.,Alex knows how to keep a conversation going. She is interesting and is open to questions. I am a very good listener and I think that I can relate to people relatively easy. But overall it was Alexs' excitement for life that allowed for such an easy conversation to be had.,There were times when the video quality would lag. I wasn't sure if it lagged for both of us and if it didnt she would probably detect lapses in my engagement with the conversation with no clue as to why. Likely she would wonder if this was due to the conversation itself as opposed to video quality.,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,9.0,40.0,60.0,5.0,6.0,3.0,1.0,7.0,9.0,7.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,25.0,,,5.0,,1.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,3.0,6.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,male,3.0,white,some_college,2.0,,7.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,29.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,3.0,5.5,5.666666666666667,2.3333333333333335,2.0,25.0,16.0,10.0,5.0,4.0,42.0,2.0,4.0,2.3333333333333335,4.333333333333333,5.0,4.666666666666667,3.0,3.6666666666666665,2.3333333333333335,4.666666666666667,,
