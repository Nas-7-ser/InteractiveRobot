I have plans with my neighbors to celebrate the fourth of July, and I have the next two days off from work. I am looking forward to having my brother back from camp, so a lot of exciting things in the next few days.","We both have had interesting experiences to talk about. We also had enough common interests to discuss. I think we have somewhat similar trajectories in life, so there was a fair amount of things to discuss. My partner was also very well at keeping the conversation going at a healthy pace. ","The video cut out on her part a few times for maybe a few minutes at most each time, but it wasn't a big deal after the first time. I kind of just went with it, and it didn't affect the conversation much. Other than that there weren't many times when the conversations ebbed.

I think it will be busy and I could get overwhelmed with the stress of competing deadlines. But on the bright side, I get to do a lot of socializing with friends, peers, and my students so that brings me lots of joy.","We kept the conversation going by sharing our own personal experiences. My convo partner was eager to start the conversation by pointing out my painting, which I was really surprised by. I think we were both curious about each other's lives so it felt easy to ask questions about travel, movies, and family because we were genuinely interested. She seemed like an intelligent person interested in the world around her, and it felt like I could bring up anything and she would be willing to talk about it.","I think I talked too much. I don't get as my opportunities these days to have long conversations with folks, and I naturally chat up people everywhere I go (on the bus, in the grocery store, at the bar). I was excited to meet someone and have that fun experience of fresh perspective. I think that translated to me wanting to share as much as possible in a finite amount of time, so I tried to fit in as much conversation as I could.
