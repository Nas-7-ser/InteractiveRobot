We talked about the red zones and the numbers of those effected.,6.0,6.0,9.0,We talked about the restaurants and the bars that are being effected by covid and the restrictions for business to stay open.  We spoke about his friends and how some of them had to serve food in their establishments instead of just drinks so that they could operate their business.,6.0,7.0,9.0,We spoke about the covid pandemic and how there were times when it was difficult to purchase essential supplies.  We also spoke about wearing masks and how he saw a person looking for a mask on the street and they just picked up a random mask that they found and put it on.

I see kids doing work at home instead of being in school and I also see many restrictions on activities that we like to do.  I am interested in seeing how this Trump/Biden campaigns go this week and well as following the up tick of the covid 19 pandemic.,"What worked well in speaking to this stranger was that we had a major world event to speak about which was covid 19. Without that as a common ground, I'm not sure just how successful the conversation would have been.  This is why I asked the first question relating to this at the beginning of first meeting him.","What didn't work well was the fact that he led the conversation and didn't know how to shut up.  I couldn't get a word in.  He didn't ask me one question and dominated the entire conversation. To say something, I had to actually interrupt him which I hate to do.  He had no knowledge of what it is like to let someone say something.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,1.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,9.0,9.0,1.0,7.0,10.0,90.0,5.0,8.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,9.0,5.0,1.0,9.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,6.0,,,5.0,,2.0,,1.0,4.0,5.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,female,2.0,white,bachelors_degree,6.0,,8.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,56.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.3333333333333333,2.3333333333333335,28.0,17.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,22.0,4.666666666666667,5.0,5.0,1.0,4.666666666666667,4.666666666666667,4.0,4.0,2.3333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,,

The differences in weather from her being on the east coast and me being down here in the southern region.,9.0,8.0,8.0,We talked about Covid a lot. And how it has affected small businesses and restaurants. Bars as well. The difference in mandates that they have versus what we have. As well as how it has affected the schools. She has 3 kids so she went into how it has affected them.,8.0,9.0,9.0,Still on the Covid topic. This time it was about wearing masks. I then brought up to see how many people will wear masks even after all this is kind of behind us. She agreed and we talked about how well our areas are at wearing our masks.,7.0,6.0,8.0,7.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,70.0,3.0,30.0,35.0,3.0,5.0,7.0,6.0,5.0,2.0,7.0,5.0,7.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,8.0,9.0,8.0,8.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,7.0,8.0,9.0,9.0,8.0,8.0,9.0,9.0,8.0,9.0,9.0,"I will do some yardwork tomorrow. Then for the rest of the work week will just be work. I work from home these days. Just a normal week for me. Will visit my girlfriend some days because we like to cook dinner together and watch some movies. I will go visit my grandpa this week, too.",We never ran out of anything to talk about. It flowed pretty easily and it was no issue to get the time limit we needed. I like that we agreed on many items and she was easy to talk to. Very friendly. I thought there was a good connection that made the conversation natural and not forced.,I thought I had to carry the conversation too much. Her answers were much shorter than mine. So then I had to talk longer to keep the conversation going. There were times when we almost had some awkward silence but I did not let that happen. I think she could have pulled her weight a little more. ,3.0,5.0,8.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,8.0,1.0,5.0,6.0,3.0,2.0,9.0,8.0,1.0,80.0,20.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,9.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,4.0,20.0,,,4.0,24.0,,,6.0,7.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,5.0,7.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,male,4.0,white,bachelors_degree,1.0,,9.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,36.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.5,6.333333333333333,1.0,1.0,22.0,10.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,41.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.333333333333333,2.6666666666666665,5.0,3.6666666666666665,2.3333333333333335,3.0,,
