Most of my time during the lockdown has been. I am unemployed but still financially stable, and I spend most of my time cooking and taking care of other domestic chores and life management--the latter meaning banking, bills, etc. I'm happy to do this because my wife is doing extra work teaching online. Making sure she doesn't have to do any housework or life management outside her paid work is my way of contributing.","We didn't have a huge amount in common in some ways--we're 26 years apart in age, different kinds of careers, different family backgrounds. But we're both white American females, college educated, stuck in our houses during a weird situation. We were both willing to share, and found some topics in common like a love of animals and our work. ","I noticed that I was asking more questions than she was. I'm not sure if that's something that didn't work as well, because we both did end up talking quite a bit. I am an investigator, and I do a lot of interviews. I tend to be curious about people and ask a lot of questions regardless of the situation--professional hazard. I did try to let the silence sit out there sometimes so that she would have the opportunity to weigh in more.

I am taking online classes and we have midterms this week and next. I will be spending my time studying, cooking and cleaning. It is the fourth of July this weekend, and my husband and I have access to a small private beach. We plan to picnic in the sun all weekend and hopefully catch some fireworks as the sunsets.","I thought it was nice to see such a friendly smiling face when I entered the chat window. We kept things positive, perhaps basic. None the less it was pleasant. I felt comfortable sharing about myself, I felt she was genuine in her sharing. I did change some details about myself and did not give my real name to protect my anonymity. I felt she was confident and kept the conversation going. Sometimes I felt nervous about what to say, this is my first time doing a video chat with a stranger. I never felt uncomfortable though. It was nice to talk with someone across the country who has also been stuck at home, and to learn about how they have been dealing with things pretty similarly to myself.  ","I do not feel like there was any part of our conversation that didn't work. At one point my volume cut out for a brief second. Other than that, there was no disruption in our connection. A few times I felt nervous about what to say, but she was very confident and kept the conversation rolling.",5.0,5.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,9.0,9.0,8.0,45.0,55.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,6.0,6.0,9.0,9.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,3.0,5.0,,1.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,female,3.0,white,bachelors_degree,3.0,,8.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,30.0,20.0,,10.0,50.0,20.0,10.0,10.0,50.0,20.0,10.0,20.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.875,6.0,1.3333333333333333,1.6666666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.3333333333333335,4.0,4.0,2.6666666666666665,4.666666666666667,3.6666666666666665,4.0,4.666666666666667,2.6666666666666665,4.666666666666667,romantic_partner,in_person
