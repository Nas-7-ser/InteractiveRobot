I'm going on a trip for the following 2.5 weeks, so I also have to be packing the right things into my car so that I can maintain myself and my business during that time. In other words, this week will be busy, and hectic, and hopefully I will be able to get everything done that I need to. I'm expecting myself to do a good job with preparations, but also to forget some things that I'll have to deal with later.","I like to ask questions when I'm first meeting somebody, and my conversational partner seemed to take those in stride. I don't feel that either of us asked overly personal questions or shared too many details for a first meeting, and I do think that comfort levels (mine, at least) got better as the conversation went on. We were able to find a few points of mutual moderate interest to talk about. Most of what we discussed fell into the category of information exchange, to me, which is a mode of conversation I'm usually comfortable with. With my best friends, I discuss emotional and intellectual things in a lot of depth, but when first getting to know someone, I've learned that that's an inappropriate way to approach a new friendship or a casual conversation, so I rely more heavily on information exchange as a form of ""small talk."" 
Small talk that involves exchanging opinions or that's stereotypically about the weather isn't something I consider myself as adept at. Walking away from a conversation with new knowledge or something interesting to think about and maybe look up feels like a success to me.","There were a few stalled points in the conversation, which I acknowledged out loud. Because I perceived my partner as less active in the conversation, I considered it my responsibility to think of new questions to ask or things to say. I think of it as my job normally to draw out the person I'm talking to until they seem to feel comfortable enough to settle into a rapport.
While I was trying to think of new things to say, I know my eyes were wandering off of the screen. I'm not sure how my conversational partner would have felt about that, if he would have perceived me as inattentive or felt self conscious about it. On the other hand, the lack of his eyes wandering (to my recollection) was part of what made me perceive him as less active in trying to establish and maintain a connection in the conversation. 
I felt pressured by the study to keep the conversation up, but I also don't feel that this was an artificial example of what I would be like in a conversation with a new person at a party or on a blind date or elsewhere. I don't feel that the situation itself caused the conversational lags we sometimes had, nor that it significantly increased my feeling that it was my job to keep the conversation going.
