So when he signed on we talked about what held him up. We also talked about our experiences with prolific.,7.0,5.0,6.0,We talked about our experiences using survey sites. I asked about where he is located and vise versa. I asked what line of work he is in and told him that I am a stay at home mom. ,7.0,6.0,7.0,We talked about Halloween and what our plans are for my kids with covid.

I have to homeschool the kids in the mornings. Our week started off with a good so I think it will finish off well. I will probably face several hiccup days with my 4 year old who is struggling with emotional control at the moment.,It was a pretty awkward conversation honestly. I feel like I was able to keep the conversation going by taking the lead a little more than I usually like to do. Having the same interests in Prolific and the studies as well as other survey sites helped carry most of our conversation.,I think that we have similar personalities and that might be what didn't work for us. Both of us were nervous leading up to the conversation. He stated he had backed out of a couple in the past because of nerves. Nerves led to some awkward pauses. We both tend to be more introverted as we mentioned in the conversation. I can be more extroverted under certain conditions this was not one of them so it felt forced.,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,2.0,2.0,7.0,7.0,3.0,50.0,50.0,6.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,9.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,15.0,,,4.0,15.0,,,4.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,female,4.0,white,associate_degree,6.0,,8.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,32.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.875,5.333333333333333,1.3333333333333333,2.0,25.0,14.0,14.0,2.0,1.0,49.0,3.0,3.6666666666666665,3.0,4.333333333333333,3.0,2.6666666666666665,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,

I honestly feel like maybe I wasn't the best chat partner for her.  She'd done this twice before and it was only my first time and I feel like if she had to compare me to her previous two chat mates, I was probably the most boring of the three, but I don't know.","Yes, there were a few moments where the video and audio lagged and it troubled me because I didn't know whether or not I missed something.  There were also a few times where her young children and husband interrupted our conversation which is understandable but it kind of ruined the flow of the conversation too.",9.0,9.0,9.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,4.0,3.0,7.0,4.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,45.0,55.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,6.0,5.0,8.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,13.0,,,4.0,16.0,,,3.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,6.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,male,6.0,white,bachelors_degree,1.0,,8.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,38.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,6.0,2.0,1.6666666666666667,27.0,7.0,2.0,8.0,3.0,44.0,2.0,2.3333333333333335,4.333333333333333,2.6666666666666665,4.666666666666667,2.3333333333333335,4.333333333333333,4.666666666666667,3.3333333333333335,4.333333333333333,,
