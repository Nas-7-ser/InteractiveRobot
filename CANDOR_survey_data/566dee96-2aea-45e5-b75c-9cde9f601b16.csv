I am looking forward to tomorrow which is my dad's birthday. Therefore I know it will be a good day!. ,"Asking questions, and expressing myself, trying to relate to her points of view and the way she sees the world. Smiling and having positive gestures and some hand movements. Also paying attention to the words and ideas she was expressing. Being honest and keeping the conversation light and enjoyable. Overall was a very good conversation. ","Something I realized is that when I spoke I took too much time, and II was very redundant sometimes, I talked a lot, I should have asked more questions. I should have focused more on her, and let her express herself better. I even felt a little sad I mentioned the time was up, I should not have, because I was enjoying talking with her.

In general, I feel good about the rest of this week.","The person was a good conversationalist and a friendly person to talk to. He was kind and knew how to ask good questions to keep the conversation going and was overall very respectful to me. This made the conversation go well. We were able to cover a variety of topics, both more shallow and deeper topics, in the duration of the conversation.","It's really difficult to keep up a conversation for a full 25 minutes without any kind of shared background experience or external stimulation. Therefore, the conversation at times became dull and forced and I felt bored. Although the topics were interesting, I was cautious to get too deep into them because a lot of the information I could have shared is private and I appreciate knowing where someone is coming from before sharing it.",5.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,7.0,5.0,50.0,50.0,5.0,7.0,3.0,4.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,7.0,,,5.0,,2.0,,3.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,female,6.0,white,some_college,1.0,,8.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,30.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.375,6.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.3333333333333335,4.333333333333333,4.333333333333333,2.3333333333333335,4.333333333333333,,
