Plus i have a few appointments for medical things so that will keep me busy too.  Just a normal working busy momma!,"Well he was very open to speaking with me although i am probably older than his mother. He was very interested in my cats so we had a great chat about that, his Japanese culture as my son is learning Japanese and his school and what he was studying.  I guess it was more like a parent-child conversation.",Nothing at all didn't work well we spoke for a very long time and I think he enjoyed my banter.  I don't think he knew what to speak to a 58-year-old woman but he did a good job and answered all my questions so I really enjoyed speaking to him!,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,9.0,7.0,9.0,9.0,1.0,55.0,45.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,25.0,,,4.0,25.0,,,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,7.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,female,6.0,white,bachelors_degree,1.0,,6.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,58.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7.0,7.0,,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,3.6666666666666665,2.6666666666666665,5.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,,

Since I cannot go out too much, I do not think any real extraordinary events could occur that would alter my average week. So, I think the rest of the week should hang on the happy side of things, mostly because I can still talk to friends and family indoors.","I think our personalities were pretty compatible for this conversation. My partner was very chatty and willing to share her views, while I was quite willing to listen. She had some pretty amusing and interesting things to say. Also, neither of us seemed particularly shy so I think that contributed greatly to the flow of our conversation.","I think the only thing that didn't work well was that my partner couldn't really find out much about me. Though I listed it as a positive, my partner loved talking about herself, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. However, this did result in me not finding many openings to talk about myself.",6.0,5.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,9.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,7.0,8.0,7.0,9.0,20.0,80.0,7.0,6.0,3.0,2.0,6.0,8.0,6.0,3.0,3.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,,1.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,8.0,3.0,7.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,male,4.0,asian,some_college,7.0,Student,6.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,20.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.25,6.0,,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,2.3333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,3.0,4.333333333333333,3.0,2.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,2.6666666666666665,,
