Being connected with a new person, even via the limitations of a video-chat makes me happy the way that extroverts and ambiverts get.

I believe that I might actually find it easier to deal with the guests at work more peaceably, though that might just be wishful thinking. He was very kind and I wish to pass that forward.",The conversation worked well when I took lead and directed the conversation; having specific topics helped to ease my partner's nervousness with speaking to a stranger. Using a bit of humour also assisted in breaking the ice between us; common ground found in the COVID-19 crisis was also useful for this. ,"I needed to give him more time to collect and frame his thoughts, to speak out so I wasn't talking over him. This happens a lot with video-chats more so than in face-to-face meetings.  There was also a distinct lack of body-language that couldn't help in the interpretation of tone or intent, which didn't work well at some points (I have a sharp voice and manner).

Even though it's the Memorial Day weekend, there's still some anxiety in my area about the coronavirus situation, and I'm in a state that has proven to be very cautious. I think it will just be spent at home with a lot of Zoom calls (which isn't bad, necessarily, just more of the same).","I was tired going into this since it started at 6:45 a.m., so I allowed my conversation partner to talk for most of the time. I think that worked really well because my brain wasn't exactly high-functioning for a good chunk of the conversation. I also could read our dynamic and knew that my partner was definitely the more talkative one.","I think I made an initial first impression about my partner based on various factors, such as how they looked and how they sounded, and I think that influenced my view of what kind of person they were in a negative way.
