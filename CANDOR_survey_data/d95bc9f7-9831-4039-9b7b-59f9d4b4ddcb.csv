I also need to look into what I need to get done before this school year starts and what I can prepare ahead of time. ",What worked well in our conversation is that we both were very good at using pauses to let the other person talked. We also both agreed about how the pandemic should be handled and discussed our own personal thoughts and experiences. We were both very calm people that had slightly similar personalities. ,It was definitely a little awkward at first. Neither of us were positive on how to start the conversation and ended up discussing one topic for most of the conversation. There was a sense of unease for the majority of the conversation (maybe first 20 minutes) so it took us quite a while to start feeling comfortable around each other. ,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,7.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,8.0,8.0,5.0,50.0,50.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,18.0,,,4.0,15.0,,,4.0,3.0,6.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,8.0,8.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,female,4.0,white,masters_degree,1.0,,7.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,24.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,4.666666666666667,,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.3333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,4.0,4.0,3.3333333333333335,2.6666666666666665,4.666666666666667,4.666666666666667,2.0,4.0,,
