I do not for-see having much interaction with many people even virtually so having this conversation with a stranger was a nice change of pace. The rest of the week I will be following my usual boring routine and not doing anything fun.","I think was worked well was the fact that we not only were around the same age range from being in college, but we also had very similar views on the world right now. I believe that by talking about topics that are very relevant in today's society, we were able to maintain a good conversation flow where we had fun and it wasn't super serious but more so like talking to a friend.","In the conversation, I did not have many problems in the conversation. I think the biggest set back was being complete strangers so at first it's a little hard to get the conversation started and warming up to one another, but once we both got more comfortable we were able to be more humorous and have more fun with the conversation.",5.0,7.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,8.0,4.0,50.0,50.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,3.0,3.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,3.0,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,female,4.0,hispanic_or_latino,some_college,1.0,,6.0,6.0,2.0,,False,,,22.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,3.0,2.0,5.5,6.0,2.3333333333333335,2.3333333333333335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.6666666666666665,4.0,2.3333333333333335,3.0,5.0,3.6666666666666665,4.0,4.333333333333333,2.0,4.666666666666667,,
