I am going to play pickleball as much as the weather permits with the cold and rain.  I have some chores around the house to do.  I also have to help my aunt with shopping.  The weather maybe cold and rainy this week so I need to keep active with indoor activities.,Chris was fairly easy to talk to.  He seemed interested in sharing his stories about travelling with a band in which he played keyboard.  I felt I was the one who changed the topic a few times.  We both seemed relaxed and the conversation flowed smoothly and we both had something to add to each topic in our conversation.,I actually felt our conversation was very easy.  Chris was willing to share things about his life in the past.  Did not talk too much about his current situation.  Did not ask him about employment just because there is so much uncertainty in the workplace for so many and I didn't want him to feel uncomfortable.,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,8.0,8.0,2.0,40.0,60.0,7.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,9.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,1.0,2.0,5.0,,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,6.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,8.0,6.0,7.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,female,2.0,white,some_college,5.0,,8.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,60.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.25,4.333333333333333,,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.333333333333333,4.333333333333333,3.6666666666666665,2.3333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,2.3333333333333335,4.666666666666667,3.6666666666666665,1.6666666666666667,3.6666666666666665,,
