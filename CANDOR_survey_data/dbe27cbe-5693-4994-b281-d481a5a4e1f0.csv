At work I'll be dealing with a lot of the same problems I deal with on a regular basis and during down time I'll be processing some images for printing on my personal laptop.

At home I think I will be preparing shelves to be painted to mount to the wall.  I'll also be donating blood on Tuesday so that'll be good.",We were both friendly with each other right off the bat.  We asked questions to get to know each other a little better and without judgement.  I talked about my hobbies and she was accepting of them and generally interested in what I had to say.  I listened to her hobbies and things she liked and gave information that may be helpful for that.,I feel like there wasn't anything that didn't work as well.  We both talked freely about topics that came to mind and there was only a small lull in the conversation before it picked back up again.

Good karma.","I think we each tried to find some commonalities but we are very different.  She is a hard core gamer who has three cats, and I do not like cats, nor do I play traditional video games.
