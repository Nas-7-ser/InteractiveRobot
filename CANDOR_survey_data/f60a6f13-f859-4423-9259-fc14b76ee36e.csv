I'm going to work each day, except Sunday. My birthday is Friday, and I was planning to go out to dinner, but it looks like I'll be picking up takeout instead. It's cold and snowy, so outside activity looks like it is going to be limited. I'm working to finish medical school applications, so that takes up most of my free time.","My partner and I had a lot in common. She is already a medical student, and I'm in the process of applying. We are both interested in healthcare, and we share similar thoughts about vaccination. I think the fact that we didn't spend our entire conversation talking about COVID made it much more pleasant.","There wasn't really anything that didn't work about this conversation. We both seem to be in the same stage of life, and have the same goals. My partner was friendly and pleasant to talk with. I think I'm a little bit older than she is, which may be a slight negative, but overall, I found the conversation great.",5.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,9.0,9.0,5.0,50.0,50.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,9.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,,1.0,2.0,5.0,,1.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,7.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,6.0,5.0,3.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,female,4.0,white,masters_degree,1.0,,6.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,34.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.125,7.0,,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,4.666666666666667,3.0,1.3333333333333333,4.0,4.0,4.666666666666667,3.0,3.0,4.0,,

I think this week has been more productive thus far, but I still have a lot of worries. I think it'll be an okay week, but not necessarily an exciting or eventful week. I do have goals to accomplish that I can only hope I'll have the energy for.","I think it worked well in that we are both interested in the medical field. We are both at different phases of life for sure, but we had many similar idealogies or beliefs about very important topics which made it very easy to talk to. With this chat, we went well over time and hadn't even noticed.","I don't think we didn't have anything that didn't work well.
