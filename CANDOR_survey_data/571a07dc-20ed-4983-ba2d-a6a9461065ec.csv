We were both open to each other, and we both talked and asked questions about each other. We had a little in common (a few hobbies and our occupations were similar). We didn't get into any controversial subjects, and just kept the conversation light.","I think the conversation that we had was fine.

I have a few things planned that are fun. Got to read some more and maybe start my wood working project. I still have to much down time but I will figure out a few projects to start to occupy my time. I am also hoping to get outside to go to a walk or two. ,We had a bunch in common and was easy for us to move from subject to subject. I think it also helped knowing that we did not need to keep it going forever. Understanding that we get to share this 30 mins with each other is enough. Interesting person I would totally talk to them again! ,I at time can get ahead of myself and talk over people. I do not mean to but I get so excited that I just start talking. Overall he seemed to be okay with it and rolled with it.
