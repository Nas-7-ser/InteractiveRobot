I think that I will be wrapping things up at work since next week is Thanksgiving, and it will be a shorter week with lots of people taking time off. I also plan on buying ingredients for Thanksgiving and have some board games to play too.","I think what worked well is we both had some movie and TV common interests. And both of us were friendly people who had done a study like this before. I think we both also built off of each other when we could - giving recommendations on shows, or asking about vacation plans.","Sometimes I felt my partner was a little low energy, but it also sounded like there had been a recent death in her family so I don't think it had anything to do with our conversation, and had more to do with her own personal circumstances. Otherwise I think this went well for a talk between strangers.

I feel better about my life after hearing what my chat partner had been through. Maybe it is a bit easier not to worry because I see other people getting through situations. ,We found some commonalities and discussed those and it worked out well when I told her some of the things I had been through and she understood and had been through something worse. It was a refreshing discussion after being under lock down so long. I am really glad you found this chat partner for me. ,"It was a bit challenging to find the commonalities to begin with but once we chatted a few minutes, they began to show up. We discussed movies that we enjoy and then some things about our lives that we have learned. It was a progression, the beginning was a bit slow, but then it speeded up.
