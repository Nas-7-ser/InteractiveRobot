The deplorable social;situation in the country, where people can't even agree on a simple thing like wearing a mask is a significant factor in that. Then there are health issues which are proving difficult to resolve, and are putting a strain on my finances. All of the above means that the coming week will probably not be easy to navigate.","Where our work was concerned, my conversation partner and I had a fair amount in common and I have a fair amount in common, even though we performed very different functions, and have very different skill sets. That provided the basis for a reasonably interesting conversation. That said, I think our temperaments are very different, which meant it was a bit of a stretch to keep the conversation going.","Michael and I share the same first name, but have very different temperaments. I saw him as somewhat introverted, phlegmatic, and not someone who makes friends easily (though he was not unfriendly). I think I'm more gregarious and outgoing, which meant that (rightly or wrongly) i'd have to work harder than he would to keep the conversation going. If we were to meet at a party, I doubt we'd spend long with each other.

I feel happy about what is happening so far. The conversation went well. My chat partner felt really happy and excited. I am glad we had a chance to talk. The rest of my week looks brighter after talking to my chat partner today. I hope he has a great week ahead too.,The conversation went smoothly. We did not have any down time of not speaking. The time flew by. We talked about where we lived and also our occupation. We both are in the similar industry of Saas (subscription as a service).  He had recently retired but we talked about what he did in the past.,"There was nothing that did not work well. We had 25+ minutes of conversation without any breaks. The audio seemed to initially not work well but then he put on headphones and it went away. For myself, the video was blurry to begin with but that went away.
