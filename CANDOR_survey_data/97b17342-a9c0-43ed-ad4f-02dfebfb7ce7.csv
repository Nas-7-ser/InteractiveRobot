It is nice to see the people there as they are very friendly, and the receptionist went to high school with me. Other than that I have very little going on. I really need to try to motivate myself to get more exercise. I have had to do a couple of chores lately and they were very hard to do. The sitting on the couch to stop the spread of disease is good for people not getting sick, but it has been a major degradation of my physical abilities. So much worse than when I first became disabled, but I am 17 years older and that age is really catching up. If I get the motivation, it will be hard physically. If not, then just hard menially and emotionally.","We mostly spoke about the Pandemic. She lives in Knoxville, and I have a sister in Tuscaloosa Alabama who is moving up to a small town near Knoxville, and we talked about for a little bit. That was probably what worked best. I mentioned that today is my birthday, I just turned 60, and she insisted that I do not look 60. So that was nice, and a little embarrassing, but it is true so I am a little used to it.","We talked mostly about the Pandemic. I mentioned that I have hypertension, and that makes me more susceptible to the illness as well as its potential effects. She said she is also hypertensive abut she had never read that. She will be looking that up in a few minutes. I hate to say I felt bad about that, but she is working from home and keeping her child home for remote learning as well, so she is taking good precautions. I di say that it was not immediately presented back in January, and I read it first April 8. Since I was upset that I had not reread the information between January and April, I was afraid I was not taking good precautions (I was still working as a delivery driver - an essential worker), so I was afraid she would be likewise upset.",6.0,6.0,7.0,5.0,7.0,2.0,6.0,4.0,1.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,6.0,8.0,6.0,45.0,55.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,7.0,7.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,male,6.0,white,bachelors_degree,3.0,,8.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,60.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.875,6.333333333333333,,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.333333333333333,4.666666666666667,5.0,1.0,4.666666666666667,3.0,5.0,4.666666666666667,2.0,3.6666666666666665,,

","There really wasn't anything critical about the conversation, Just trying to figure out a good topic that we could talk about. Once we got to that point everything went smoothly. We discussed things like the pandemic and where we lived. I also found that we both had sons that were born on the same day.","Kind of like I said for the last question.
