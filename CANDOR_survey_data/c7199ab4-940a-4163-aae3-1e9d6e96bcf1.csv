I am going to see some of my family that I have not seen in seven months because of the virus. I am excited to spend time with them. It's the weekend so it is always more relaxing for us. ,The gentleman was very easy to talk to and friendly. He was interesting because he was from a different section of the country and extensively well read and traveled so I could learn from him. He was very easy going and we were close to the same age bracket. We had more in common than the previous person I spoke to. ,"I think the only thing that might not have worked well was that we spoke over each other once in a while. But really, that happens in every day conversations. It is harder to judge online though. It was a little dicey when we brought up politics because you never know where the other person stands, but we navigated that just fine.

I'm having dinner with some friends tonight which ought to be fun as well.,Everything worked as it should have. We didn't have any technical issues and we found common things to talk about. We both have some of the same interests which was helpful. We are both about the same age which gave us some things to talk about. Overall it was pretty good for a conversation with a complete stranger.,It took a little time to find common ground. I have traveled a ton and she had not so it was kind of difficult to find things in common at first. Once we found a few things we had in common it was just fine.
