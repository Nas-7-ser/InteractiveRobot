She said how she almost named her cat the same name as my dog, we talked some about pets showing up in our online classes right now.

I've been feeling very dizzy today though, so I don't feel 100%. ","We took turns talking, and it overall went very smoothly. We covered all the basics, and I think we got along pretty well too. We had a good amount in common, such as pets, going to school, general views on stuff. We both seemed pretty goofy and humorous as well, which I always enjoy in a conversation. ","I think it started out sort of forced, like we were just listing off a bunch of things about ourselves without much conversation starting.
