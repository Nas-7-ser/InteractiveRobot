We did a few of those questions and then found a common area of interest genealogy.  He talked about his family history and I talked about my family history and some interesting stories from my family tree.  We also both have kids so that we had something in common.,I think initially after the introductions we struggled with what questions to ask.  I think we initially struggled with finding a common interest and each talked about our answers to his question bank.  I think each of us struggled with who should go first and the level of detail to provide.    ,5.0,7.0,9.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,7.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,6.0,7.0,5.0,60.0,40.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,8.0,8.0,3.0,3.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,24.0,,,4.0,25.0,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,4.0,7.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,female,6.0,white,masters_degree,1.0,,6.0,6.0,2.0,,False,,,39.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.25,6.0,,2.3333333333333335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.3333333333333335,4.0,5.0,2.6666666666666665,4.666666666666667,2.0,4.0,3.6666666666666665,2.6666666666666665,3.0,,
