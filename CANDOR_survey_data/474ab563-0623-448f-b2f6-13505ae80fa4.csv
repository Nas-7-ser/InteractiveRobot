I do feel low energy and that affects how I organize my time and feel confident about being able to do tasks that I need to. I do feel like more things require effort now though. ,We both had an interest in true crime which was really the only thing that kept the conversation going I felt. She also let me lead a lot and talk so I felt like I was able to keep the conversation moving along and the time not to drag so much. ,It seems like perhaps my partner does not have a lot of practice in talking with strangers or perhaps she does not care to follow social cues. And maybe that is my own insecurity happening where I did not go with her flow and tried to keep the conversation moving along at a pace that was inconsistent with her rhythm and needs. ,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,8.0,2.0,3.0,8.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,7.0,1.0,80.0,20.0,2.0,7.0,8.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,,,4.0,0.0,,,2.0,1.0,3.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,female,6.0,white,masters_degree,7.0,"small business owner, but looking for more stable side employment",8.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,33.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.625,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.666666666666667,3.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,4.333333333333333,3.6666666666666665,1.0,3.3333333333333335,2.3333333333333335,4.0,2.0,,
