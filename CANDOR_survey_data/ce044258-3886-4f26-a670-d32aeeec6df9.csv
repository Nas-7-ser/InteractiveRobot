I am just sitting at home during the quarantine, making money online and hanging out with my family. Everything is good for my future, so I am not super stressed out. And I've developed a pretty strong routine during the quarantine- I've become a creature of the quarantine. I'm generally excited for the rest of the week.","We were both students and had a lot to talk about. Sometimes in conversation, one person will ask all of the questions or vice versa, but we were pretty even in asking each other questions. And we had a lot in common. She had visited the university I'm going to in the fall back when she was looking to apply for schools.","We had some difficulty letting the conversation flow naturally. A lot of the time it goes question --> answer and then things go from there, but ours was question --> answer most of the time.

One of my friends just got a new puppy and I am going to be dogsitting for her which is something I'm looking forward to. I am done with my schoolwork for the semester so I will soon be able to relax and spend my time doing fun things.,"We were pretty similar people. We both grew up in the U.S., and lived outside major cities. We talked about a lot of high school classes which we had both taken, and about the transition to online school which we both recently had to go through. Overall I think we were pretty similar people so the conversation wasn't awkward.",At some times it seemed like my conversation partner would glance down at her phone and I would feel like it was my responsibility to carry the conversation with someone who wasn't really listening. It is also always slightly awkward having a video chat because delays in the video cause you to interrupt each other.,2.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,8.0,4.0,3.0,60.0,40.0,5.0,4.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,7.0,7.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,16.0,,,4.0,11.0,,,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,female,3.0,white,bachelors_degree,7.0,Student,8.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,22.0,5.0,,50.0,25.0,25.0,0.0,0.0,50.0,10.0,15.0,25.0,0.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.75,5.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.3333333333333335,4.0,4.333333333333333,2.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,2.6666666666666665,4.0,4.333333333333333,2.0,4.0,family,in_person
