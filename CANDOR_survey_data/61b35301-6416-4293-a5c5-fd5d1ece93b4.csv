I discussed being in Grad School at Notre Dame, and what I study. She discussed being in undergrad at a small liberal arts college near Nashville (I believe). She is a politics major and we discussed how interesting that must be during an election year. She discussed learning about all of the stuff going on ""behind the scenes"" and how its scary to learn about but also she'd rather learn about it than not know. We discussed how the current election feels like voting for the lesser of two evils, more so than perhaps in previous elections, but this is her first time voting. She mentioned that it made her feel better to vote for local positions as well because in those positions there are actually people who she agrees with rather than just picking who she disagrees with less. We chatted about how age influences the decisions of presidents and I talked about wanting some younger candidates. ",8.0,8.0,8.0,"She switched to a ""light topic"" after we discussed politics and asked if I had any pets. I introduced her to my puppy Jax and then asked about her pets. She said she has two dogs back at home with her family and she misses them very much. We then take about the scheduling of the semester for Fall 2020 and if her school altered the schedule. They have a similarly altered schedule to Notre Dame and are ending before thanksgiving and then resuming in February. We talked about where we are from originally. ",8.0,9.0,9.0,"We talked about our siblings and what they do and in general about our families. She has two siblings, a younger brother and an older sister. Her older sister is a graduate of Princeton and is taking a gap year to do research before applying to Vet school. Her younger brother is in the military and she is not sure what he is currently doing because she hasn't been in touch with him recently. She is the middle child and both are close in age to her. I talked about my five siblings and what the oldest two do for work/school. We talked about how it will be so nice to visit our families over the extended break and be home for the holidays.

The only thing that I am concerned about which might make it not go well is I am waiting for results of a biopsy I had done. If I do not receive these results or if the news is bad news, that will make my week go less well, naturally. ","Everything about the conversation worked well. The conversation felt very natural, turn taking was good, we had plenty to talk about because we have a lot in common in terms of both being students. She was friendly and it made the time pass by quickly because it didn't feel like I was struggling to find things to talk about ","I really don't think there were things that worked ""not well"" in our conversation. The only thing I would say is we were maybe hesitant to discuss politics at first because we naturally do not know each others politic affiliations but we navigated that space well I think and the conversation was very comfortable in my opinion.
