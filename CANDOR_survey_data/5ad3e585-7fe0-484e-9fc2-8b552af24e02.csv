Some of our conversation involved her wanting to hear more about running and how to get into it and I gave her some tips. This also made me admit that I haven't been running due to the pandemic and need to get back into it.,Well we had a lot to talk about with the pandemic going on and the riots. It felt like every conversation topic we had flowed very smoothly into the next. Somehow we ended up at running and exercise. Work. We also both let each other talk I feel like an equal amount. Hopefully I didn't ramble and listened.,Honestly it all was much better than I thought. I was coming in nervous and my first impression was oh what am I going to talk about with this person that is completely different than me. I think we had some similar viewpoints. She obviously likes sports so I tried to entertain that but I know nothing. ,6.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,8.0,1.0,60.0,40.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,9.0,9.0,6.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,1.0,5.0,,2.0,,6.0,6.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,8.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,male,6.0,white,some_college,2.0,,7.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,30.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.625,6.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.6666666666666667,2.0,2.0,4.666666666666667,3.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,5.0,1.0,3.3333333333333335,,

I also have some workouts planned, and possibly going to dinner with some friends where we will also probably watch a baseball game.","Blaine was very personable and easy to talk to.  He told me about where he lived in Seatle and some of the current events going on there; i.e., the protests.  He was very pleasant and articulated himself well, and he even gave me some tips on getting into running.  It was a great conversation and I really enjoyed it.","I can't think of anything that did not work.  The audio and video worked well and there were no issues.  We were able to keep the conversation going with no lulls, and overall it was a very enjoyable experience.  I am glad I had the opportunity to do this.  I enjoy meeting new people, and he was a nice guy.",5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,8.0,8.0,5.0,50.0,50.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,6.0,8.0,8.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,,2.0,,3.0,3.0,4.0,6.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,female,4.0,white,some_college,1.0,,5.5,7.0,2.0,,False,,,58.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.625,6.0,,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.333333333333333,4.666666666666667,5.0,3.6666666666666665,5.0,3.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,3.0,2.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,,
