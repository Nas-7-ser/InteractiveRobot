Have tomorrow off and a long weekend coming up where I'm going with my wife to the beach, which will be a nice time to relax and unwind. We're going to go to a brewery, rent some bikes and ride around, so a very relaxing and peaceful time!",The lady in the conversation was very pleasant. We shared a few interests and experiences that made the conversation flow pretty well. We didn't run into too much talking over each other (which happens quite a bit on video chat) and we managed to move on from subject to subject pretty easily.,"Not really sure to be honest. It all worked pretty well. If I had to split hairs I would say that we are in two completely different demographics (she's an older lady, I'm a younger guy) so there wasn't too much that we could connect over, but we did end up sharing some experiences so I guess it worked out in the end.",5.0,7.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,5.0,50.0,50.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,9.0,9.0,4.0,2.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,male,3.0,white,some_college,1.0,,6.0,5.0,2.0,,False,,,36.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.125,6.0,1.0,1.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.333333333333333,4.0,3.0,1.3333333333333333,3.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,4.333333333333333,3.3333333333333335,2.0,3.3333333333333335,,

I have a schedule of plans that involve spending time with loved ones, reading, writing and exercising.  On Saturday, I will engage in good conversation with friends at an outside cafe. I will reach out with friends through phone calls, texts and houseparty. Overall, the rest of my week will be great.  ","The conversation worked well because my partner was open to conversing. He was relaxed, smiled,  a good listener, and we took turns offering information and asking questions. My partner was a great conversationalist.   We made eye contact and found a lot in common.  We found common subjects to discuss and found our commonalities.  ","Right at the end of the conversation, we came to a pause, and that was probably the only part that didn't feel a bit off, but I am sure we would have found a common ground in a few seconds.  I was a bit nervous going into the conversation because I had tried to do this 4 times and no one showed up.
