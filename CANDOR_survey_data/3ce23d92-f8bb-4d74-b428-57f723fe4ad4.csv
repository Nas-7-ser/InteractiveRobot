I have tons of doctor's appointments and it is my week to see to get my daughters (split custody). I feel like I won't have much down-time, or as much me-time as I would like to have. I'm worried about how the rest of my week will turn out. ","What worked well in the conversation was that my partner smiled alot and he was relatable. We also shared the love of God, and the love of books together which was really nice. He was a nice person to talk to, and I definitely could envision myself being friends with him. ","What didn't work in the conversation we just had is that I felt like it was too short, and I also felt extremely nervous. I felt like my partner was judging me based on my appearance and he was way too ""good"" to be my partner. Other than that, I thought it was great.

Work is slowing down so I have more free time. I plan to be productive in my free time and make a little extra money through my side hustles. I think it will be good overall, however they will be some additional stress due to school starting up soon.","I think the fact that we were both very friendly and have a common interest, of getting through this quarantine, contributed to our mutually enjoyably conversation. The only thing that did not work well is that my partner was very open about her personal life and was willing to share information that I was not willing to share about myself.",The only thing that did not work well was that my partner was willing to share personally information that I was not willing to share.
