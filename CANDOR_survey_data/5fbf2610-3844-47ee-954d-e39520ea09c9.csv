We were both good about listening to each other and my chat partner in particular was very good about keeping eye contact.  His smile really helped me be less tense in the conversation.","I think the biggest issue we had is we both had moments where it was difficult to figure out a good thing to throw out there as a topic to discuss.  We had a lot of time to fill and not necessarily have topics to discuss as I was prepared to talk about a couple hobbies that had no particular reaction, and he was big on basketball (which is not a personal sport of interest).",9.0,4.0,3.0,6.0,5.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,1.0,7.0,5.0,4.0,7.0,9.0,3.0,70.0,30.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,7.0,4.0,2.0,,,4.0,2.0,,,1.0,3.0,2.0,7.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,male,2.0,white,masters_degree,1.0,,7.0,6.0,2.0,,False,,,39.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.375,5.0,3.0,2.0,27.0,19.0,12.0,5.0,2.0,47.0,2.3333333333333335,2.3333333333333335,4.666666666666667,3.3333333333333335,5.0,2.0,4.666666666666667,3.3333333333333335,1.0,2.0,,
