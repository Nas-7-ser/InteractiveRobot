We began by finding out where we both were from and how we are handling the pandemic. We made a shift to politics when I asked her how her home state of Michigan is leaning in the upcoming election. She somewhat surprised me when she said the wealthy neighborhoods around her are displaying pro Biden signs and the working class areas lean towards pro Trump. ",9.0,9.0,8.0,"The middle of our conversation was somewhat sad, discussing people we have lost in our lives. Her husband passed away ten years ago from lung disease, which sadly is what many people are now dealing with during the pandemic. We discussed my father passing away, my brother in law dying 9/11, all sorts of depressing things but strangely the conversation remained somewhat upbeat.  ",9.0,9.0,9.0,"The end of our conversation pretty much kept the direction of the middle part. We continued to talk about our personal losses and how we are coping with the pandemic. We talked about younger relatives that we are involved with and some funny stories about relatives who refuse how to learn to drive. We got into politics again,  I definitely don't agree with her politics, but I made a point of not being confrontational because she seemed very nice and why bother at this point. All in all I liked my chat partner very much.

Besides that and work, I'm completely invested in the upcoming election and will continue to follow it as closely as I can. It seems to me the culmination of the past four divisive years is finally coming to it's conclusion and I'm fascinated by the potential outcome.   ","I thought we had an easy going demeanor about the two of us that worked well. I can't say we had a great deal in common but I think we had a good conversation without going to deep into the specifics of our lives. Actually, we did share some sad stories about loss but we seemed to have a good understanding of each other and got along well. I found her to be a very nice lady.",Nothing didn't work in my opinion but we did get into some sad personal stories about our lives. I feel very badly for my chat partner having losing her husband to lung disease ten years ago but she was so candid and natural about it I never felt uncomfortable discussing it. The worst thing I can say about the conversation was she was four minutes late but that honestly didn't bother me at all. ,5.0,6.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,8.0,8.0,9.0,9.0,4.0,55.0,45.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,7.0,9.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,5.0,7.0,5.0,,1.0,3.0,4.0,25.0,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,7.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,7.0,5.0,6.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,male,4.0,white,bachelors_degree,1.0,,7.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,39.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.25,6.0,,1.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.333333333333333,4.333333333333333,4.666666666666667,1.3333333333333333,4.666666666666667,3.3333333333333335,4.666666666666667,4.666666666666667,2.0,3.3333333333333335,,

We agreed that most people are already sure of who the are voting for and what they believe. We had alot in common about life experience's and how we felt about them.
It was good to talk to someone who had same experience as yourself.",Really this is hard to answer because it seemed everything worked out well.
