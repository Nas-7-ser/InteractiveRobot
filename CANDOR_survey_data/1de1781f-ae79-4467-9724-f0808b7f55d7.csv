We also talked about employment and COVID-19, and how that had affected our lives as far as school and work. I shared that my brother used to live in the town that my partner lives in now, so we talked about that city for a bit.",6.0,7.0,6.0,"Around the middle, I believe we talked about video games and video game development.

Tomorrow is Friday, so I will likely see some friends and hang out with them. On Saturday, I plan to go hiking by myself, which I am looking forward to. I find that being outdoors alone is good for my mental health. On Sunday I will likely do some homework.","Something that went well for our conversation was our many shared interests, such as video games and music. It made it so we could have something in common, and made the conversation more comfortable. We were able to share recommendations for things that we were interested in, knowing that the other may be interested in it as well.","I can't really say that anything about the conversation was bad. My partner was easy to talk to and didn't shy away from any questions, and gave full answers as well. One issue I guess would be that I accidentally spoke over him, but I stopped, apologized, and allowed him to finish his thought.
