I stay home and keep myself quarantined for the most part. I have hypertension so I am afraid of any exposure to Covid19. My ex-wife is diabetic, so again I want to limit my exposure so that it can not get back to her from our contact or contact between me and any of our 3 children as they all live with her. They have done their part by going on leave of absence from work as did I, and we have all since lost our jobs for the continued absence. Their mother has had to work throughout. She did get to do some work from home in April and May but has had to go in since and is even working a lot of hours now. My son's financial aid is in place and his school wanted a payment already so we are on a payment plan and that is going to work out fine. My daughter's school has only awarded and applied part of her financial aid. I expect they are waiting to get a better count of students before finalizing it. This same school awarded her additional aid last year for the second semester as a number of students did not return for the second semester and they were redistributing aid. Last year she was fully covered by the aid available so I am hoping for the same. As it sits now we owe a lot, but that first payment is due September 16, so I will plan for the worst and hope for the best.","Simone was very friendly and willing to talk about just about any subject. We in fact covered a range of subjects, starting with the affable discussion of weather but proceeding apace from there where we actually discussed current politics in the US but only for a few moments. We discussed school the most. Simone's children are young and in school, my youngest are in university, but their mother works for the local school district so I am more aware of the happenings of the district than most people whose children are graduated. This is what lead to the politics as school has become more political on the national stage this year.","I have trouble thinking of anything that did not work. I started out with introduction, my name where I live. Simone contributed by asking about what is happening where I live. She mentioned she lives in the DC metro area, but we did not really discuss it. I imagine it is hard for people in other areas to disconnect the national politics from the local area and what is happening or what matters to them, especially parents of school age children.",8.0,7.0,9.0,3.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,9.0,4.0,7.0,9.0,3.0,55.0,45.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,6.0,8.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,,1.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,,6.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,male,6.0,white,bachelors_degree,7.0,"unemployed but not currently looking for work due to covid19, I will find a job when it is safe.

We're supposed to make a nice noodle soup for my mom and I think it will be something nurturing to do. I like getting together and eating together. ,"I think what worked well in our conversation is discussing intelligent topics, such as family, the pandemic, life in the pandemic and current events. Additionally, I think we shared some understandings such as gaming and technology or education. It felt more as an intellectual conversation and being able to connect in that way. ","I think my partner enjoyed sharing and I enjoy listening to what he had to share so the conversation went well overall. I can't really think of anything that didn't go well, honestly! We talked about neutral topics and stayed away from those that often are not recommended in first time conversations, actually we did touch upon politics but we agreed or shared the same point of views.
