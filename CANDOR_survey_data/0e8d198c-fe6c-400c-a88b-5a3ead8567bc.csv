I will probably do some laundry and change my bedding. I do have a Chiropractic appointment tomorrow. next Monday I have a hearing test and my initial appointment with a new ENT doctor referred to by my primary care doctor. So I will get to see if there is anything he wants to try to help with my tinnitus. Also on Monday is report day for Unemployment. So I will get to see is I qualify for the federal extension on unemployment or just the state. The state was 20 weeks, they extended to 26 weeks, and I have received 26 weeks. The US government has extended benefits to 57 weeks, and while I receive PUI, the federal benefits, rather than the state benefits (I was only part time and did not make enough to qualify) from what I have read, I will not get extended because I was part time. I will continue to report just in case they change their minds on that or add additional benefits again.","We were both willing to talk about ourselves. We both tried to find subjects that we could both talk about. While we had little in common, we worked those things in common to create a conversation, and that lead to other topics that allowed for a wide varied conversation. We encouraged each other.","Evan was a little late to the conversation, and I had just checked the time and was about to stop waiting when he arrived. He blamed it on technical difficulties. He is a big sports fan. I am not. But he did mention hockey, and I have learned how to make a little conversation with hockey fans.

He seemed very outgoing and able to keep the conversation going easily. Also, I was a little bit late to the conversation and so he was able to stick around and wait for a few minutes for the conversation to start which was very helpful for me.","As I'm sure the video of the conversation will reflect, the conversation was very one-sided. I didn't say much at all and even when I did say something sometimes he would even cut me off and continue with what he was saying.
