She seemed to have a ton of experience about Russian literature, history, and contemporary society. I really enjoyed picking her mind about her experiences in Russia and especially about the opinions about the USSR and the old lady's story about living through the siege of Leningrad.","I really am hard pressed to find things about the conversation that I did not enjoy. We ended up really bonding over leftism, our identities as multilingual and american immigrants, and our appreciation for careful consideration of Russia, Cuba, and other socialist nations.

I'm going to be quite busy and my new job will be tiring, but I loo forward t further talking to this new friend I made. I also feel reinvigorated about my passions and love for my college major, which was something I needed.","I think the fact that my partner asked a lot of questions and let me speak worked really well for keeping the conversation going without many awkward times in between. He was also genuinely interested in what I had to say and contributed relevant information rather than just asking questions for the sake of asking. It also helped that we had a lot in common just naturally, from background to politics.","I believe the beginning of the conversation was rough because there was a lot of overlap i us talking and trying to find a conversation rhythm. By this I mean, while it was good that he would ask questions he often asked them while I also tried to ask him something at the same time.
