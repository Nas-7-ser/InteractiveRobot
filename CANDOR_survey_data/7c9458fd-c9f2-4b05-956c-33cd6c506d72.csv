It is Saturday right now, so it is the last day of the week, depending on who you ask.  I plan to go food shopping later and then make a nice chicken dinner and then relax on the couch with my wife.","I thought our conversation was very natural, like two old friends catching up after not seeing each other for a long time.  We both were very open and willing to talk to each other.  We enjoyed what the other had to say and did not pay attention to how much time was passing as we spoke.","At first there was not a lot in common, but using general ice breakers and simple thoughts allowed us to start it up.

This was absolutely delightful.  I am appreciative for the opportunity to chat with Steven and hopeful for the future of humanity.  Perhaps it was the safety of the two dimensional image on the screen, but I felt very comfortable meeting the ""strange man""  and having a conversation with him.   ","We learned a lot about each other without being intrusive.  What worked well was that we respected each other's privacy and were very careful not to be confrontational or unpleasant.  Once you make kindness your objective, it's an easy goal to reach.  I think we each wanted to make our chat partner comfortable.  This was an exercise in giving/offering instead of consuming/taking.  ","This was a Perfect Conversation that would make the President quake with envy.  It was easy to ask questions and learn more about someone when  the first thing you learn about them is their name.
