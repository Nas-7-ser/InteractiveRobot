I expect to finish my self-appointed task of organizing my new computer system. I expect the week to be rather low-key in the personal area, as a few birthdays and special events have already passed by, and this will be a recovery time.","Lloyd and I had much in common, in terms of age and verbal skills. We were both relaxed, and he had good manners, apologizing profusely for being just a minute or two late. I learned a bit more about how people are dealing with the current crisis in his part of the world. We both were curious enough about the exercise and each other to ask questions, and there were no awkward silences.","Most of the conversation did work well, but I found I had to do most of the prompting at the start of the conversation.  As he got more comfortable, I still took the lead in the types of questions asked. He also seemed to not want to reveal much about his personal life, which is fully understandable, but it did mean some answers were a bit chopped off.

We had been to some common locations and were able to share those experiences.  Overall, she was just very good at carrying a conversation.  She would be a hit at most parties.","I was about 2 minutes late.  I tried to open the site on my iPad and it didn't work; had to switch to computer.
