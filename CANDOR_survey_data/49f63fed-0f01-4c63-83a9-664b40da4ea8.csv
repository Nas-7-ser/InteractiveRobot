I asked where she was and if it was warm there and she said she lived in Georgia and that it was warm and that she's staying at the beach for vacation. She also mentioned that she has 3 daughters and her husband with her and I told her that I was staying with my parents.",7.0,6.0,6.0,"We talked about music for a bit and I showed her my guitars, she said she doesn't really play any instruments but tried piano when she was younger. We talked about what kinds of music we listen to and she said she liked two bands coheed and cambria, and ludo and that she went to a concert for them one year. We talked about our jobs, me looking for work in computers and her working in child care. We talked about how covid has changed things and how she's working remote and her kids were doing online classes.",7.0,6.0,7.0,We talked about the kinds of shows we watch and websites we use and hobbies we do. She said she watched Game Of Thrones and that her kids watched Avatar. I talked about some of the hobbies I've been doing with woodworking and home brew and baking. She said she made banana bread. She mentioned that she used reddit and since I also use reddit we talked about different subreddits we use.,7.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,85.0,4.0,35.0,50.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,1.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,5.0,8.0,7.0,8.0,7.0,6.0,7.0,8.0,6.0,8.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,I think the rest of the week will go well. I'm hopeful for the future because I'm waiting to hear back on my job search. I'm looking forward to trying out a new video game. I feel motivated to try to get some exercise because I've been sitting still for too long.,I think one thing that worked well about the conversation is that we both had the intent to have a conversation for 25min and therefore were both interested in keeping the conversation going. I think we both had equal chances to speak though I spoke less just because that's the way I am. They were a very kind person as well.,I think one thing that didn't work as well is we didn't have a lot in common overall. But that was kind of negated by the fact that we were both interested in hearing what the other person had to say and learning more about them so it didn't matter. One result of that though is I think it makes the conversation more surface level which isn't a bad thing since that's expected in a conversation between strangers.,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,45.0,55.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,8.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,,2.0,,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,8.0,7.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,male,4.0,white,bachelors_degree,2.0,,9.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,23.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,6.0,,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.666666666666667,3.6666666666666665,2.0,4.0,,

I think he was surprised to  learn that I use reddit which he does too. we talked about a lot of different topics and kept the conversation going even though we did not have that much in common.,The conversation had some lulls and kind of awkward moments. I think maybe because we are in different life stages and did not have as much in common it made the conversation a little more difficult.
