We also could relate on various topics, so that allowed us to take turns rather than it to be one sided and exhausting.","I can't think of anything in particular that did not work well between me and my partner.

In short, it's alright eh.","My conversation partner seemed responsive and was able to take my subject and questions and roll with them. She was also rather friendly and had no issue talking about more touchy subject or ""heavier"" things. The thing that worked the best, however, would be our commonalities which allowed us to talk about things we both could relate to, and then the general ""fluffy-ness"" of the conversation's tone. It not being serious made it easier to talk ","Multipul times I had to either repeat myself or re-explain myself to my conversation partner, none of which were due to technical issues but more related to either the subject matter at hand or what I said exactly. This was the biggest issue as it lead me to try and keep the conversation topic simple and not share any more complex thoughts. This however can also reflect directly back on me and my inability to accurately depict or describe what I am talking about, as well as my limited understanding on the subject causing me to be unable to explain it in another way.
