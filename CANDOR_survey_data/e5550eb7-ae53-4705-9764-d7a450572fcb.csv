It's been a pretty normal week for me overall so hopefully it will stay calm and easy. I have to run some errands and take my husband to the dentist later in the week so I'll stay somewhat busy for sure.,I found that we had enough in common that it was easy to keep a steady flow of pleasant conversation so that worked super well. We had a lot of shared experiences and interests so that helped us both have things that we could talk about without there being any pauses.,There were times where it was hard not to interrupt my partner because we did not have the non verbal cues the way we would've had in person.
