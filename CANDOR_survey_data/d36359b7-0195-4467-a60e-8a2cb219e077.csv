I look forward to the rest of the working and schooling week and am excited to finish the rest of the week out being very productive and happy. ",The conversation worked well because my partner kept up the conversation good asking a lot of questions and I had a lot to say to answer. The conversation flowed really well and it seemed like we didn't talk very long at all and weren't struggling to keep the conversation flowing. ,I think it was mainly just me talking a lot and he asked questions and I talked more and I noticed I seem to interrupt sometimes so that wasn't very good. That was just me though and I think he wasn't bad at conversation but just heavy on the questions.,5.0,5.0,9.0,5.0,7.0,2.0,6.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,8.0,6.0,4.0,7.0,2.0,70.0,30.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,8.0,7.0,8.0,9.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,,1.0,1.0,5.0,,2.0,,5.0,6.0,3.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,female,3.0,white,completed_high_school,7.0,Freelancer,8.0,8.0,2.0,,False,,,30.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.5,6.0,,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,3.3333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,2.6666666666666665,5.0,4.666666666666667,1.3333333333333333,4.0,,

I hope my week goes well.,I think a critical point was her opening up about her kidney problem and how that changed her life.  I think that opened her up to talking about other things that are important for her.  I didn't talk much but I think it went well because I got her to talk about herself.,I think the fact that I didn't talk much about myself or my life kind of hurt the conversation.  I focused too much on her talking about her life and her kids.
