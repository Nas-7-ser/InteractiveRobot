I mentioned being in college and looking for a job and she mentioned her job.,7.0,7.0,7.0,"We talked about several things such as musical instruments, how I play guitar and she tried to learn piano at one point. We talked about our living situations, me living with my family and her living with her boyfriend. We talked about pets, I have two dogs and she wants a pet but can't get one due to her living situation.",7.0,7.0,8.0,"We talked about prolific and other similar websites out there.

I feel good right now because I have things planned and I cleaned up my room. I'm hoping to hear good news on my job search and have an interview today. So I am hopeful that things will go well.,I think what worked well is that we both were engaged in keeping the conversation going. Sometimes talking to people I feel unsure whether they want to keep talking or not and I drop the conversation. Knowing that we each planned to talk for 25 min made it so we both were engaged in continuing to talk for that long. It also worked well because she was a kind and friendly person who was easy to talk to.,"I guess one thing that didn't work as well is we didn't find as much personal common ground or interest to talk about. Our conversation was about more general things like covid, travel, family, and pets. Obviously there's nothing wrong with that but I don't consider myself a very outgoing person and so the interactions I've had that lead to more long term friendships we had a lot of more specific things in common to talk about like video games and anime and music. They were very nice just that if I had to pick out something that didn't work as well it'd be that the conversation mainly stuck to getting to know you type of questions but that's not a bad thing, I think that's expected for a short conversation with someone you just met.",4.0,4.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,3.0,3.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,45.0,55.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,6.0,8.0,8.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,22.0,,,4.0,22.0,,,3.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,8.0,5.0,9.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,male,4.0,white,bachelors_degree,2.0,,8.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,23.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.375,6.0,2.0,2.0,31.0,9.0,9.0,8.0,3.0,30.0,1.6666666666666667,3.6666666666666665,3.0,3.3333333333333335,4.0,4.0,4.666666666666667,3.3333333333333335,2.6666666666666665,4.0,,
