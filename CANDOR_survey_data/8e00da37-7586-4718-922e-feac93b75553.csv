I hope to get some more exercise in and get our ceiling leak fixed.  I also hope to learn a few more things- personal goals during this pandemic. I also hope to find resources of money-making opportunities.,"What worked well was that even though there was age difference and lived in different states, we had a lot to compare and talk about because of going through the pandemic.  He also was going into a profession that I did years ago.  I found that he and I seemed to agree politically as to what is going on which surprised me because of the age difference. ",There really wasn't anything that comes to mind that didn't work well in the actual conversation.  I do feel I was prepared with questions and hints to keep the conversation going as well as when to end it but I feel that was because of our age difference.

In addition to this, my partner's talkativeness had helped to keep the conversation flowing as I was slightly struggling to find questions and topics to come up with on the fly.","There wasn't anything in particular that didn't work well in the conversation that I had with my partner.
