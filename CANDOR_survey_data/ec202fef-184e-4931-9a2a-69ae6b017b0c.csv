I expect that I might have a future problem with an infected tooth that I mentioned in the chat, and may need to go see a dentist. I think I will most likely be able to get it under control for the immediate time, and wait a little longer in quarantine. 

","I think we both enjoyed many of the same topics and that interest really helped to keep the conversation going, despite some awkward pauses. I think she was very kind and easy to talk to, not very critical of me being nervous, as she was nervous herself. I think she was very interesting, with good conversational skills, and that helped to keep the rhythm of the conversation going.","I have a problem with not always knowing when to talk, and so I interrupted on occasion and I think this was the largest issue. She on the other hand was very good with this skill. We were both nervous, and that caused some awkward pauses. We were both on a timer, which I think created some awkward moments as well. 

We both seemed to be introverts, which caused some issues, but it went really well considering. I think we sometime weren't sure what was appropriate for a topic of conversation, and had to navigate that.",9.0,8.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,7.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,9.0,4.0,55.0,45.0,7.0,3.0,4.0,6.0,7.0,8.0,9.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,5.0,,1.0,1.0,4.0,24.0,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,female,4.0,white,some_college,6.0,,4.0,9.0,2.0,,False,,,34.0,1.0,,0.0,100.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.625,6.0,2.3333333333333335,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,3.6666666666666665,3.0,3.3333333333333335,5.0,2.3333333333333335,4.666666666666667,4.666666666666667,3.0,5.0,romantic_partner,in_person

But my conversational partner talked about watching the OA so I might actually try to do that. I'm probably going to have to go exercise and go back to a that same daily routine. My friend and I also talked about possibly hanging out sometimes next month, so I may also try that as well. ","It was very interesting to talk to someone from a different state. I only lived in the state I am my whole life, so it was so different to hear someone who have to deal with stuff such as hurricanes and floods. Our living situation was also different as well and I got to hear someone's experience from another point of view. ","I think talking on a video chat is different than talking in person. There are certain cues that made it difficult to know when to start and stop a conversation (for example, knowing how to exit out a conversation). Interaction-wise, what didn't work out as well was trying to figure out what we have in common and what we didn't have in common. This makes starting a conversation difficult.
