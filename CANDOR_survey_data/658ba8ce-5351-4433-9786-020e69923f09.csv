Then I learned about her coding crisis and data collection dilemma as she wades through grad school during covid. ,7.0,7.0,9.0,"we spoke about weather in our two areas and a bit about working from home.  We discussed tattoos, her sister and all the dramatic changes she makes to her appearance and how she showed signs of concern for her getting a new restaurant serving job during covid. ",7.0,7.0,9.0,We mostly discussed how we were both getting a bit stir crazy about not being able to move about freely during this pandemic.  I would also note that during the entire conversation I could literally feel her stress through the screen.  She just wants to be able to go to restaurants and be with people again. ,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,3.0,30.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,7.0,4.0,6.0,1.0,8.0,2.0,9.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,3.0,8.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,5.0,5.0,8.0,8.0,5.0,8.0,3.0,8.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,"I feel inspired to write a new series of articles so I don't think i'll see much down-time for a while.  Since I cannot feel safe leaving the state or the country I will continue trying to drown myself in work, in hopes that when I can finally move around freely i'll have more money to do that with.","What worked well is that I'm an empath.  She oozed stress through the screen and her level of intensity was palpable.  I've had plenty of friends go through grad school so it was easy to sympathize with her position.  I could also see how covid was compounding her situation and, I tried to be an ear for her.","I cannot remember her asking me one question about myself.  Maybe she's so used to or maybe even tired of, asking questions in a clinical setting that she is more used to that.  She seemingly was on the quiet side and, I think she made her possible distraction be clear from the get-go.  I'm not even sure if she got over the mic issue even a bit after it was resolved.",1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,9.0,5.0,1.0,55.0,45.0,3.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,9.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,2.0,,4.0,20.0,,,1.0,1.0,5.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,8.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,female,6.0,white,some_college,1.0,,7.0,7.0,2.0,,False,,,48.0,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.25,4.666666666666667,,2.3333333333333335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,1.6666666666666667,3.0,3.3333333333333335,2.6666666666666665,3.0,,

We were able to find various things to talk about and keep the conversation going with minimal lulls. We were able to find some things in common and I believe we made one another feel a little better. ,"I felt like I was not particularly present in terms of asking questions, showing empathy, etc. It felt like a conversation that was particularly focused on me, which was probably a result of my bad attitude coming in and frustration related to the microphone.
