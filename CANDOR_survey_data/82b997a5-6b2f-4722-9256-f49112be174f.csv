We enjoyed talking about our pets and our personal experiences with the pandemic and how it is affecting our lives.  We were also able to compare the weather trends and differences between our 2 very different locations,"We had a large age gap so it made it a bit difficult to connect with him.  He had younger siblings that are the same age as my children so that was different.  Other than that, it was a pretty easy conversation to have.

I might study with a friend if she's not too busy, but we'll see.","During the conversation we had a fairly good dynamic of bringing up a topic then each sharing our experiences with it. Though we did not have much in common, we found it relatively interesting to share our differing experiences, especially with things such as the weather and where we live.","My conversation partner and I did not have very much in common.
